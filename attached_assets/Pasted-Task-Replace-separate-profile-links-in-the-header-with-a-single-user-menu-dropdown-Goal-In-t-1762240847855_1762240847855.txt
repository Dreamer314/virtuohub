Task: Replace separate profile links in the header with a single user menu dropdown.

Goal

In the main header, when a logged-in user clicks their avatar/name area on the right, open a dropdown menu with:

- View public profile
- Profile settings
- Log out

There should be ONE hover/click region that covers both the avatar and the username/handle. No separate behavior depending on whether the user clicks the avatar or the text.

Stack / context

- React + TypeScript
- Supabase Auth
- React Router (Link / useNavigate)
- Existing hooks:
  - useV2Avatar() → returns the current profile’s avatar URL
  - useV2Handle() → returns the current profile handle string (e.g. "virtuohub_found")
- Existing header component: client/src/components/layout/header.tsx
- Existing logout behavior already exists somewhere in the header (a “Log Out” button or handler) – reuse that logic rather than inventing a new sign-out flow.

What to implement

1) Header user section → dropdown trigger

- In client/src/components/layout/header.tsx, locate the user section on the right side that currently shows:
  - avatar image (or fallback circle)
  - @handle / display name
- Wrap the avatar + text in a single clickable area that:
  - visually highlights on hover/focus as one unit
  - on click toggles a dropdown menu.
- Remove the previous behavior where avatar click goes to public profile and username click goes to settings. Both should now just open the same dropdown.

2) Dropdown menu (desktop)

- Implement a simple accessible dropdown menu attached to that user area.
  - It can be a small popover menu component placed under/right-aligned to the trigger.
  - You can either create a minimal custom dropdown or use any existing menu / popover component already used in this project. Do NOT bring in a brand new heavy dependency just for this.
- Menu items and behavior:
  - “View public profile”
    - When clicked, navigate to `/u/${handle}` where handle comes from useV2Handle().
  - “Profile settings”
    - When clicked, navigate to `/settings/profile`.
  - “Log out”
    - When clicked, call the existing logout logic. Prefer to reuse any existing `handleLogout` or supabase signOut call already used in the header.
- Styling:
  - Match the existing header / dropdown styling (border radius, colors, shadows) used elsewhere in the app.
  - Ensure hover/active states for each menu item.
  - Keep it compact; this is a simple account menu, not a big panel.

3) Mobile behavior

- In the mobile header / menu:
  - Use the same dropdown logic OR render the same three actions in the existing mobile menu structure.
  - The key requirement is that on mobile there is still a clear way to:
    - View public profile
    - Open profile settings
    - Log out
- It’s OK if the exact UI on mobile is slightly different as long as the three actions are present and consistent.

4) Remove redundant “Log Out” button

- If there is a standalone “Log Out” button/text in the header, remove it on desktop and rely on the dropdown menu instead.
- On mobile, keep only one primary way to log out (either inside the dropdown or as a single menu item, but not duplicated).

5) No backend or schema changes

- Do NOT touch the database schema or any tables.
- Do NOT change profiles_v2 columns.
- This task is **UI only** in the client.

Acceptance criteria

- Hovering over the avatar/name shows a single consistent hover state for the whole area.
- Clicking that area opens/closes a dropdown with exactly 3 items:
  - View public profile
  - Profile settings
  - Log out
- “View public profile” navigates to `/u/<current-handle>` and works for my existing profile (virtuohub_found).
- “Profile settings” navigates to `/settings/profile`.
- “Log out” signs the user out using existing logic and returns them to whatever the app currently uses as the post-logout screen.
- No more direct-click navigation on the avatar/name; everything goes through the dropdown.
- No schema or server changes.

Please show me the final diff for client/src/components/layout/header.tsx (and any new small UI component you create for the dropdown) when you’re done.
