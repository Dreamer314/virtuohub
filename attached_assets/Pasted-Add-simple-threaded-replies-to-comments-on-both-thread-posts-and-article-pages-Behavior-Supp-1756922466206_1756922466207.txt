Add simple threaded replies to comments on both thread posts and article pages.

Behavior:
- Support one level of nesting (comment → reply). Do not allow replies to replies beyond depth 1.
- Under each comment, show actions: Reply, Like (with count), and timestamp.
- When “Reply” is clicked, render an inline reply textarea below that comment with Submit and Cancel.
- If a comment has more than 3 replies, show only the first 3 and a “View N more replies” link that expands inline.

Mock API:
Create/extend /src/data/mockApi.ts with:
  listComments(postId): Comment[]
  addComment(postId, body, parentId?) -> Comment
  toggleLikeComment(commentId): Comment
Store comments in localStorage under "vhub.comments". Seed each test post with 2 top-level comments and a few replies. Use the Comment shape:
  { id, postId, parentId?, body, author:{id,name,avatar?}, createdAt, likes }

UI:
- Render top-level comments, then replies indented by ~16px with a subtle left border.
- Reply composer appears inline when Reply is clicked; ESC or Cancel closes it.
- Show empty state “Be the first to start the conversation.” when no comments exist.
- Add basic limits: max 1000 characters; prevent empty submissions.
- Call a logEvent helper on submit: logEvent("AddComment", { postId, parentId })
- Keep the current visual style (typography, colors, radii). Do not change overall layout.

Performance & safety constraints (for the mock/localStorage build):
- All data persists via localStorage only. On first load, seed once; afterwards, never overwrite user data.
- Wrap localStorage JSON.parse/JSON.stringify in try/catch; if corrupt, reset only the broken key.
- Keep payloads small: limit comment length to 1000 chars; limit post body to 5,000 chars.
- Do not store full File objects. For images, store a base64 preview capped ~1MB; otherwise show a “file too large” warning.
- Debounce comment/post submits to prevent double-submits (e.g., 500ms).
- Use a mock currentUser (id, name, avatar) for stamping comments and likes; no real auth yet.
- Add a tiny logEvent(name, payload) that console.logs: "AddComment", "Reply", "LikeComment", etc., so we can verify flows.
- Never change layout or styling; these constraints are invisible to the user.
