You are a senior Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind engineer. Perform a precise refactor. Do not invent new themes. Use the site’s existing design tokens and the three modes (light, dark, charcoal). Maintain accessibility.

0) Source control safety

Create a new branch feat/unify-charts-in-lists.

Proceed only on this branch.

1) Remove the stray Charts route and duplicates

Find and delete or hard-redirect any top-level or duplicate routes named pages/charts, app/charts, or app/(community)/charts that are not under the Community Lists route.

The canonical implementation must live on the Lists page.

If a charts data module was created elsewhere, keep the data, but remove duplicate UI components that are not used by Lists.

2) Where this feature must live

Edit the existing Lists index route: usually /community/lists under the Community layout shell.

Keep the left nav and right rail exactly as they are in the Community shell.

The center column should contain, in order:

VHUB Charts section (hero + tabs + active chart table)

Community Lists grid below it

No new standalone Charts page should remain after this change.

3) Fix the center-column width and margins

In the Lists page center column, enforce the same max-width and gutters used by other Community center columns. Do not change the left or right column widths.

Ensure the center content does not overflow or compress because of wrong container classes. Use the same wrapper component the Feed uses.

4) VHUB Charts section details

Section header:

Eyebrow: “VHUB Charts”

Title: “The scoreboards of the immersive creator economy.”

Right-side meta: “Last updated”, “Methodology” (modal), “Suggest update”

Optional sponsor chip: “Presented by <Sponsor>”

Tabs shown as a pill group:

VHUB 100 — “The top 100 creators across immersive platforms ranked by multi-signal reach and impact over the last 30 days.”

Platforms Index — “Where creators are thriving most, based on earnings potential, engagement, and activity.”

Momentum 50 — “The fastest rising creators, streamers, and studios over the past 30 days.”

Studios Watchlist — show a “Coming soon” card only. No table.

Under the active tab, render the one-line definition above the table.

5) Chart table design and gating

Columns: rank number, avatar, name, secondary line with platform pills, metric block (label + value), movement chip (▲ +N, ▼ −N, NEW), optional streak “#1 for 3 weeks”.

Rank numbers use tabular numerals and a larger size for rank 1.

Add subtle row hover and small motion on movement changes.

Gate VHUB 100: show only top 10 for non-Pro, then a frosted overlay with a centered Upgrade CTA. Other charts show full list.

6) Filters for the Charts section

Keep a compact filter bar under the tabs:

Voice: VHub Picks, User Choice

Platform multi-select

Sort: Most Recent, Most Viewed

Sync with URL search params. Do not add more chips.

7) Community Lists grid remains below Charts

Do not alter its route or card design beyond existing tokens.

Keep type chips (Charting, Upcoming, Best Of, Entertainment) and platform pills as metadata.

Ensure the grid respects the same center-column max-width and gutters as above.

8) Visual hierarchy utilities

Add or reuse small utility classes (Tailwind @apply allowed). Do not add new theme tokens.

.vh-hero: display-xl, weight-800, tight leading

.vh-title: display-l, weight-800

.vh-eyebrow: uppercase, tracking-wide, text-accent, text-xs, weight-700

.vh-meta: text-sm, opacity-80

.vh-rank: text-3xl, font-bold, tabular-nums

.vh-chip: shared chip styles for NEW, up, down, streak, VHub Picks, User Choice

Apply these in ChartHeader, ChartTabs, ChartTable.

9) Data layer

Keep or move chart data helpers to lib/data/charts.ts:

getChartById(id)

getChartsList()

Seed JSON with at least 10 entries for each of: VHUB 100, Platforms Index, Momentum 50. Watchlist can be a stub.

ChartEntry:

id: string; rank: number; name: string;
avatarUrl?: string; platforms: Platform[];
metricLabel: string; metricValue: number;
movement?: number; isNew?: boolean; streakWeeks?: number;
voices: VoiceTag[]; // 'VHub Picks' | 'User Choice'


Do not render placeholder strings. Show computed counts and labels only.

10) Cleanup and deletion

Remove any unused components created by the previous charts attempt.

Remove any extra center-column widgets. Right-rail widgets must stay in the right rail only.

Ensure no duplicate headers like “Presented by …” appear twice.

11) Tests and checks

Add unit tests for:

Rank sorting and movement chip rendering

Pro gating cut-off for VHUB 100

URL param round-trip for filters

Pass typecheck and lint.

Verify responsive behavior at sm/md/lg/xl.

Verify visuals in light, dark, and charcoal modes.

12) Acceptance criteria

Route remains /community/lists only. No separate Charts page exists.

In the center column, VHUB Charts appears first, then the Community Lists grid.

Layout matches the Community shell margins. No overflow or extra-wide sidebars.

Charts show clear hierarchy, tabs, definitions, and correct gating.

Right rail shows events, spotlight, pulse reports, trending. Left nav unchanged.

If any existing file structure differs, adapt paths but preserve the intent above. Document deviations in README and keep the final route at /community/lists.
