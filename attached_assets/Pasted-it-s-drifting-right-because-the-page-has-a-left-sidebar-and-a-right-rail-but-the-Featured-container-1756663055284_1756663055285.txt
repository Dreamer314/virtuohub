it’s drifting right because the page has a left sidebar and a right rail, but the Featured container only “reserved” space for the right rail. Fix it by mirroring the left rail and removing the little left shift on the image.

Here are two clean ways. Pick one.

Fast fix (minimal edits)

Reserve space for both rails on the Featured container.

Remove the negative left margin on the media.

Change your container classes:

// before
<section id="featuredV2" className="relative mx-auto max-w-[1400px] px-6 md:px-8 lg:pr-[360px]">

// after (match these to your actual rail widths)
<section id="featuredV2" className="relative mx-auto max-w-[1400px] px-6 md:px-8 lg:pl-[240px] lg:pr-[360px]">


Kill the left nudge on the media wrapper:

// before
<div className="relative md:-ml-6 xl:-ml-12">

// after
<div className="relative md:ml-0 xl:ml-0">


That centers the whole card between the 240 px left nav and the 360 px right rail.

Bulletproof fix (exact centering between rails)

Wrap Featured in a 3-column grid that matches your rails, and put Featured in the middle column. This cannot drift.

{/* page section wrapper */}
<div className="relative grid lg:grid-cols-[240px_minmax(0,1fr)_360px]">
  <div className="hidden lg:block" />   {/* left rail spacer (nav) */}
  <section id="featuredV2" className="col-start-2 mx-auto max-w-[1400px] px-6 md:px-8">
    {/* your existing Featured grid (media + text + arrows) */}
  </section>
  <div className="hidden lg:block" />   {/* right rail spacer (sidebar) */}
</div>


If you use the arrow overlay that spans the section, update its right edge so it clears the right rail:

<div className="pointer-events-none absolute inset-y-0 left-2 right-2 lg:right-[380px] flex items-center justify-between">


Adjust 240px / 360px / 380px to your real rail widths.

Quick sanity checks

At 1280 px width, measure the gap from Featured’s bounding box to the left nav vs the right rail. They should be roughly equal.

Make sure no parent around Featured has text-align:right, float, or an extra translateX.

Keep the media wrapper without negative margins after you add lg:pl[...].
