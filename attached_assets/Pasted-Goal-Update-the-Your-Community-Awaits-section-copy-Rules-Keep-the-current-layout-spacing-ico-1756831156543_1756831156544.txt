Goal: Update the “Your Community Awaits” section copy.
Rules:

Keep the current layout, spacing, icons, images, and CTA styles.

Replace text only (headlines, subheads, bullets, card titles/descriptions, captions).

Remove any promises about built-in marketplace or AI tools.

Add a small “Coming next” teaser list in muted text under the “What you’ll get” bullets.

Do not rename classes or restructure markup.

1) Section hero

Headline (replace existing):
Build in Public. Level Up Faster.
(If you prefer an alternate flavor, here are approved options you can swap in without changing layout: “Make. Share. Improve.” or “Ship together, not alone.”)

Subline (replace existing small paragraph):
VirtuoHub is where immersive creators post WIP, get feedback, and turn threads into collaborations across VR and UGC platforms.

(Keep the logos row as is.)

2) Left column block

Left block headline (keep structure):
You don’t have to be a pro to begin

Left block body paragraph (replace):
Beginners get unstuck and veterans find collaborators. Share work in progress, ask for help, and learn how the industry actually works.

Under the two images, replace captions:

Image 1 caption title: Start here
caption text: Your first WIP into 3D and worldbuilding.

Image 2 caption title: Keep growing
caption text: Better every week with peer feedback and practical tips.

“What you’ll get” list (replace bullets with the list below):

Organized threads with categories like WIP, Help & Feedback, Jobs & Gigs, Assets for Sale, Events, and General

Editorial you can trust: Interviews, Spotlights, Tips & Guides, Industry News, and Pulse Reports

Lightweight profiles, simple DMs, and polls that capture the community’s voice

Add a muted micro-list directly under the bullets titled “Coming next” (small, subdued text):

Courses & live workshop library

Smart creator tools

Creator marketplace

Analytics & talent network dashboards

(Use text-sm opacity-70 or equivalent to style the “Coming next” list.)

3) Right column block

Right block headline (keep the “Your creativity…” title but update copy below):
Your creativity should pay you back

Replace the three card titles + descriptions to tie them to the community feed:

Card 1 title: Showcase and sell your work
description: Post assets, tag “Assets for Sale,” and link to your shop or marketplace.

Card 2 title: Build with collaborators
description: Find teammates, post gigs, and ship worlds people actually use.

Card 3 title: Teach and share what you know
description: Announce workshops or streams, share threads, and grow your audience.

4) “We built what we needed” quotes

Keep the block and styling. Update (or keep) the three bullets/quotes to the following:

“Why isn’t there one hub where creator Q&A doesn’t get buried?”

“WIP + feedback is how I actually get better — not another algorithm.”

“Where do I even find collaborators or students for my workshop?”

5) Bottom banner

Mini-headline (keep): The industry is changing fast

Small paragraph (replace):
UGC platforms evolve monthly. VirtuoHub keeps creators in the loop so you can adapt and grow.

CTA: keep the existing button label and style. If needed, set primary CTA to Join the Community with existing microcopy Create your free account today.

6) Accessibility (quick text-only updates)

Ensure the two images have descriptive alt text:

Image 1 alt: “Early 3D head model—work in progress”

Image 2 alt: “Refined character head—improved after feedback”

Why this is better (for context only—do not render on page)

Reflects what VirtuoHub does today (threads, categories, profiles, DMs, polls, editorial).

Keeps the motivational “Day 1 → Week” idea without overpromising tools.

Connects “sell/build/teach” directly to how the community enables it (posting, linking, collaborating).

Adds a small “Coming next” teaser to hint at the roadmap without turning this into a pitch deck.
