Rebuild Featured from scratch and cut over

“Replace the existing Featured section with a fresh, isolated implementation and delete legacy markup for it.

Cutover plan

Create components/featured/FeaturedCarousel.tsx and components/featured/types.ts.

Render it on the Community page at the same position. Keep the old section behind a feature flag FEATURED_V2. Default to V2.

Remove old Featured files after V2 passes acceptance.

Hard isolation

Wrap the new section with:

section#featuredV2 classes: relative isolate not-prose overflow-visible

data-scope="featured"

Do a sweep and remove or override any ancestor classes affecting typography or width near the old section: .prose, .container, .max-w-*, overflow-hidden.

Ensure no parent sets overflow:hidden on the new section’s ancestors. If found, move it down to only where it is needed.

Layout spec

Stage: relative mx-auto max-w-[1400px] px-6 md:px-8 lg:pr-[360px] (adjust the 360 px to your right-rail width).

Grid: relative grid md:grid-cols-[1.8fr_1fr] gap-20 xl:gap-28 items-center.

Media:

Wrapper relative md:-ml-6 xl:-ml-12

Frame w-full aspect-[16/9] min-h-[360px] xl:min-h-[440px] rounded-2xl overflow-hidden shadow-[0_0_90px_rgba(120,100,255,.16)] ring-1 ring-white/8

<img class="w-full h-full object-cover object-center" loading="lazy">

Radial glow behind frame: absolute div with bg-[radial-gradient(closest-side,rgba(120,100,255,.18),transparent_70%)]

Text column:

cq max-w-[38ch] md:mr-2 and add global CSS: .cq{container-type:inline-size}

Date small muted

Tag chip + optional type

Title uses fluid, balanced wrapping:

classes text-balance text-pretty keep-words leading-[1.05] tracking-tight text-[clamp(2.25rem,6cqi,3.75rem)]

helpers: .text-balance{ text-wrap:balance } .text-pretty{ text-wrap:pretty } .keep-words{ word-break:keep-all }

Blurb text-lg text-white/80 mt-5

Controls

Arrows anchored to section edges, not the image:

Wrapper: pointer-events-none absolute inset-y-0 left-2 right-2 lg:right-[380px] flex items-center justify-between

Buttons: pointer-events-auto h-12 w-12 md:h-14 md:w-14 rounded-full bg-white/6 backdrop-blur ring-1 ring-white/15 hover:bg-white/10 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-white/40

Dots below card mt-10.

Keyboard: Left and Right navigate. Space toggles autoplay.

Autoplay: 5s, pause on hover or focus inside the section.

Accessibility: aria-roledescription="carousel", aria-live="polite", buttons labeled with current index.

Data model

Create components/featured/types.ts:

export type FeaturedItem = {
  id: string
  dateISO: string
  tag: 'Creator Insights' | 'Spotlight' | 'Tips & Guides' | 'Industry News' | 'Tech'
  type?: 'Interview' | 'Article' | 'Video'
  title: string
  blurb: string
  ctaLabel: string
  ctaHref: string
  imageSrc: string
  imageAlt: string
}


Do not use “Interview” as a tag. Use it as type.

Anti-clobber checks (fail the task if any are true)

Any ancestor of #featuredV2 sets overflow:hidden.

The media <img> does not have object-cover.

The text column computed width > 45ch or < 30ch.

The left or right arrow bounding box overlaps the media bounding box.

The title renders with more than 5 lines at 1024 px width (reduce with the clamp automatically, do not edit the title).

Remove legacy constraints

Search and delete or scope down rules that target generic tags near Featured:

Global h1, h2 font sizes that override Tailwind classes.

.container or .content wrappers setting max-width and paddings around Featured.

.prose typography styles that change heading sizes in this region.

Any img { max-width: 480px; } style, or width utilities like w-80 on media wrappers.

Acceptance

At 1280 px wide viewport:

Media frame visible at ~16:9, at least 60 percent of the grid row width.

24 px minimum gap between media frame and text column.

Arrows sit outside the frame and do not overlap it.

Title auto-balances without manual edits.

ESLint passes. No console errors.

After acceptance, remove the old Featured files and references, and commit with a summary of files added, deleted, and lines reduced.
