You are a senior Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind engineer. Work only with the site’s existing design tokens and the three modes: light, dark, charcoal. Do not invent new theme variables or colors. Maintain accessibility.

Context: what is wrong right now

There are two chart sections on /community/lists. A legacy “VirtuoHub Charts” block appears below the new VHUB Charts header. This creates repetition.

The table mixes creators and platforms in the same chart. Column header says “Creator/Platform” which is ambiguous.

Filters and badges are not contextual. Voice badges appear on the Platforms Index where they do not apply.

The one line chart definition is not placed directly under the active tab.

The Lists grid includes items about Studios even though Studios is not live.

VHUB 100 gating after Top 10 for non-Pro users is not obvious.

Center column widths and margins drift from the Community layout on some screens.

Goal

Keep one charts section at the top of /community/lists, then the Community Lists grid below it. Charts feel like scoreboards with the right entity types, filters, and copy. Layout uses the Community shell with correct gutters. No duplicate blocks.

Do this, in order
0) Safety

Create a new branch: fix/charts-unify-lists.

1) Remove the duplicate charts block

Find and delete the lower legacy charts component on /community/lists that renders “VirtuoHub Charts” with tabs like Top Creators, Most Downloaded Assets, Fastest Growing Studios, Top Platforms to Earn In.

Remove its imports and any unused styles. Confirm only one charts section remains.

2) Keep charts inside the Community layout

Do not create a new page. The canonical route is /community/lists.

Ensure the page uses the standard Community shell with left nav, center column, right rail.

Fix the center column to the same max width and gutters used by Feed.

3) Tabs and definitions

Tabs: VHUB 100, Platforms Index, Momentum 50, Studios Watchlist.

Immediately under the active tab, render one sentence that defines the metric:

VHUB 100: “The top 100 creators across immersive platforms ranked by multi-signal reach and impact over the last 30 days.”

Platforms Index: “Where creators are thriving most, based on earnings potential, engagement, and activity.”

Momentum 50: “The fastest rising creators, streamers, and studios over the past 30 days.”

Studios Watchlist: “A curated radar of teams to watch.” For now show a coming soon card only.

4) Contextual filters

For VHUB 100 and Momentum 50: show Voice (VHub Picks, User Choice), Platform multi select, Sort (Most Recent, Most Viewed).

For Platforms Index: hide Voice. Only Platform multi select and Sort.

Sync all filters to URL search params. Do not render chips that are not active.

5) Table schemas per chart

Use a per chart column config. Do not mix entity types.

VHUB 100 (creators only)
Columns: Rank, Avatar, Creator, Platforms, Metric {label: “Impact Score”, value}, Movement chip (▲ +N, ▼ −N, NEW), optional Streak “#1 for N weeks”.
Show VHub Picks and User Choice badges on rows when applicable.
Gating: if user is not Pro, show only Top 10, then a frosted overlay with an Upgrade CTA.

Platforms Index (platforms only)
Columns: Rank, Platform logo, Platform name, Category, Metric {label: “Creator Earnings Index”, value}, Movement chip, optional Streak.
Do not show VHub Picks or User Choice badges.
Add an info tooltip on the Metric header that reads: “Composite score using earnings potential, creator activity, and engagement trend over the last 30 days.”

Momentum 50 (creators only)
Columns: Rank, Avatar, Creator, Platforms, Metric {label: “30 day growth”, value}, Movement chip, NEW badge for first timers.

6) Charts header

Top of the section:

Eyebrow: “VHUB Charts”

Title: “The scoreboards of the immersive creator economy.”

Right side meta: Last updated, Methodology button with modal, Suggest update link

Optional sponsor chip: “Presented by <Sponsor>”

7) Lists grid hygiene

Section title: “Community Lists”

Hide or rename any Studios cards until Studios is live.

Do not duplicate content that the charts already show.

Keep type chips (Charting, Upcoming, Best Of, Entertainment) and platform pills as metadata only.

8) Visual hierarchy helpers

Use small utility classes. Do not add new tokens. Tailwind @apply is fine.

.vh-eyebrow uppercase, tracking wide, text accent, text xs, font bold

.vh-hero display xl, font extra bold, tight leading

.vh-meta text sm, opacity 80

.vh-rank text 3xl, font bold, tabular numerals

.vh-chip shared chip style for NEW, up, down, streak, VHub Picks, User Choice

Apply these in ChartHeader, ChartTabs, ChartTable.

9) Data layer

Charts must read from a single source: lib/data/charts.ts with getChartById(id) and getChartsList().

Each entry has an entity type: "creator" or "platform".

Do not print placeholder strings such as “10 entries”. Compute from data.

10) Cleanup and checks

Remove unused components from the deleted legacy block.

Confirm center column does not overflow and matches other Community pages.

Verify responsiveness at sm, md, lg, xl.

Verify visual contrast and focus states in light, dark, charcoal.

11) Tests

Unit tests for:

per chart column config renders correct headers

Voice filter hidden on Platforms Index

VHUB 100 gates after 10 for non Pro

URL params round trip for filters

Acceptance criteria

/community/lists has a single charts section on top and the Community Lists grid below.

VHUB 100 and Momentum 50 show creators only with correct badges and movement.

Platforms Index shows platforms only with the earnings index and its tooltip.

No legacy “VirtuoHub Charts” block remains.

No Studios content appears until that feature is live.

Layout uses correct margins and gutters in all three modes.
