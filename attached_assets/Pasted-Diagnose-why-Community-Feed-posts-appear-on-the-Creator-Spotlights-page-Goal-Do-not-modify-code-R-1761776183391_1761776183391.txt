Diagnose why Community Feed posts appear on the Creator Spotlights page

Goal: Do not modify code. Read the repo and explain why the Creator Spotlights page renders a Community Feed section with “Showing 5 spotlights | Clear filters” and post-style cards beneath the Featured Spotlight block. Produce a short report that cites file paths and relevant lines.

Context clues from screenshots:

The page header shows “Creator Spotlights.”

Below the correct “Featured Spotlight” block, there is a second section with the Community Feed UI: “Showing 5 spotlights | Clear filters,” tags, and the like/save/comment bar.

The Featured Spotlight block and the small spotlight tiles look correct. Clicking “View Full Spotlight” opens a mocked spotlight detail page, which is fine for now.

Repository questions to answer:

Which route file renders the Creator Spotlights page, and what components does it mount under the Featured Spotlight section?

Likely paths to check:

client/src/pages/spotlights.tsx or client/src/pages/creator-spotlights.tsx

Route config in client/src/App.tsx or wherever routes are defined

Which component prints the string “Showing X spotlights | Clear filters”? Identify its file and how it ends up on the Spotlights page.

Is the Spotlights page importing any of these: CommunityFeed, FeedList, PostList, FilterBar, or a FeedProvider?

For the leaking section, what data source is used? Confirm whether the fetch calls supabase.from('posts') or a shared “posts” fetcher with a filter like tags contains 'spotlight' or category = 'spotlights'.

What powers the correct Featured Spotlight block and the mini spotlight tiles? Are they using a local mock array like spotlightsData.ts, or a spotlights table?

Are we rendering PostCard for the second section instead of SpotlightCard? If yes, note the exact component and usage site.

Are there any shared layouts or wrappers that always mount a feed section under certain routes?

Deliverable:

A concise report that lists:

The exact component that introduces the feed section on the Spotlights page, with file path and the prop values being passed.

The data query used by that component, including table name and filters.

Whether the Featured Spotlight content is local mock data or a distinct table.

A minimal plan to keep for later, not to apply now, that states which component to remove or replace, which query to point at, and which card component to use.

Important constraints:

Do not change any files.

Do not auto-run code that writes to the filesystem.

Limit output to analysis and file references only.
