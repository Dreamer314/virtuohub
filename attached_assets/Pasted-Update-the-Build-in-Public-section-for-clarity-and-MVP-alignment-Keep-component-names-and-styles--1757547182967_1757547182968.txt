Update the “Build in Public” section for clarity and MVP alignment. Keep component names and styles. Comment edits with // BUILD IN PUBLIC.

1) COPY
- H2: "Build in Public. Get Real Feedback."
- Subhead: "VirtuoHub is where immersive creators share WIP, get reviews, and turn threads into collaborations across VR and UGC platforms."
- Left lead paragraph: "Beginners get unstuck and veterans find collaborators. Share progress, ask for help, and learn how the industry actually works."
- Left cards:
  - Card 1 title: "Start here"
    Card 1 body: "Your first WIP post and worldbuilding log."
  - Card 2 title: "Keep growing"
    Card 2 body: "Weekly peer feedback and practical tips."
- Right column H3: "Your creativity should pay you back"
- Right list items (render as interactive buttons/links):
  1) "Showcase and sell your work"
  2) "Build with collaborators"
  3) "Teach and share what you know"
  Each button links to /community with a category filter where available:
    - sell -> /community?category=sell
    - hire-collab -> /community?category=hire-collab
    - tutorials -> /community?category=tutorials
- Proof bullets H4: "What you’ll get:"
  Bullets:
    - "Organized threads with categories like WIP, Feedback, Tutorials, Events, and General"
    - "Editorial you can trust: Spotlights, Tips, Industry News, and Pulse polls"
    - "Lightweight profiles, simple DMs, and polls that capture the community’s voice"
- Founder POV H3: "We built what we needed"
  Three bullet quotes as shown in the mock.

2) PLATFORM CHIPS
- Replace the long plain text list with a capped set of clickable chips (8 max) using existing tag/pill component:
  ["Roblox","GTA FiveM","Second Life","VRChat","Fortnite","Minecraft","Unity","Unreal Engine","+ more"]
- On click, route to /community?platform=<slug>. Use a small toast "Filtered by <name>".
- On mobile, make chips horizontally scrollable.

3) INTERACTION AND ROUTING
- The three right-side buttons should navigate and open the composer if "?compose=true" is present in the current URL. Support deep links:
  /community?category=sell
  /community?category=hire-collab
  /community?category=tutorials
- Preserve the existing compose handling from /community (compose param).

4) ACCESSIBILITY
- All chips and right-column items are buttons or links with aria-labels like:
  aria-label="Filter community by Roblox"
  aria-label="View posts in Sell Your Creations"
- Headings maintain a logical order.

5) RESPONSIVE
- At <md, stack columns. Replace two face cards with a simple one-item carousel or stack with equal spacing. Ensure no overflow.

6) ACCEPTANCE
- Copy matches exactly.
- Chips render, are clickable, and filter.
- Right-side items link correctly and reflect category slugs.
- No layout shift at 360, 390, 414, 768, 1024. No console errors. Prettier run.
