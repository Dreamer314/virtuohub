Update the VHub Pulse frontend copy and small UI behaviors. Do not change routes, data models, or backend logic. Keep existing classes and layout.

1) Header copy (Pulse section/page)

Replace the header block with these exact lines, in this order:

Title: VHub Pulse

Tagline: Cast your vote. See results.

Subhead: Quick polls on Immersive Economy topics.

Helper line (single line only): Have your say.

Remove any extra helper sentences under the header.

2) Poll card text and badges

Remove the left-side label text VHub Pulse on the card header.

Keep (or add) a pill on the right that reads: Official VHub Poll.

Above the options, set the hint to: Choose an option to vote.

3) Results visibility rule (resolve current conflict)

Implement a threshold so results do not show too early:

Hide the result bars and percentages until totalVotes >= 5.

While hidden, show a small line: Results visible after 5 votes.

When totalVotes >= 5, show the bars and percentages, and hide that line.

4) Footer line on the card

Replace any current footer copy with:

Ends in {time} • One vote per account.
Use the existing time variable (e.g., endsIn).

5) Comments label

Change any “Join Discussion” label to a simpler count:

{{commentCount}} comments
If there is a separate link, label it Discuss.

6) Platform chips row

If the poll has no platform tags or is marked cross-industry, hide the platform chips row entirely. Only render chips when tags exist.

7) Accessibility touch-ups (frontend only)

Ensure each option is a real <input type="radio"> with a visible focus state.

Each option should include visible percent text when results are shown (do not rely on color alone).

Add aria-label like: aria-label="Select {{optionText}} to vote".

8) Search-and-replace scope

Update copies in the relevant components (for example PulseHeader, PulseCard, PulseSection, etc.). Do not change spacing, colors, or icons.

Acceptance criteria

Header shows exactly four lines ending with “Have your say.”

Each poll card shows only the Official VHub Poll pill (no duplicate “VHub Pulse” label).

Hint reads “Choose an option to vote.”

Bars and percentages are hidden until 5 votes, with the small line “Results visible after 5 votes.” visible before that.

Footer reads “Ends in {time} • One vote per account.”

Comments show as “N comments.”

Platform chips render only when tags exist.

No layout shifts on mobile.
