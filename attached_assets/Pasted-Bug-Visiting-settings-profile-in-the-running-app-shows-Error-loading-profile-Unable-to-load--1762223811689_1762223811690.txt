Bug: Visiting /settings/profile in the running app shows:

"Error loading profile
Unable to load or create your profile. Please try again."

I am logged in (I see my handle and logout button in the header), and we already created a v2 profile + account_prefs row for this user directly in Supabase.

Please debug and fix this in SMALL STEPS. Do NOT run big audits or refactors.

Constraints:
- Do NOT change any database schema, RLS policies, or SQL migrations.
- Use the existing profiles_v2 and account_prefs tables exactly as they are.
- Keep Profiles v1 behavior (comments, spotlights, feed) untouched.

What I want you to do:

1) Find the settings page code
   - Open client/src/pages/profile-settings.tsx (or whatever file you created for the profile settings).
   - Identify the function that:
     - gets the current auth user
     - loads the active profile from profiles_v2/account_prefs
     - and/or creates a default profile.

2) Add temporary logging
   - Log the result and error of every Supabase call in that flow:
     - the call that gets the current user
     - the call that reads account_prefs
     - the call that reads profiles_v2
     - the call that inserts a new profile or prefs
   - For each, console.log both the data and error objects and a short label (e.g. "loadPrefs error:", etc.).

3) Re-run the app and explain the REAL error
   - Reproduce the /settings/profile page load.
   - Look at the browser console and/or server logs.
   - Tell me exactly which Supabase call is failing and what error message it returns
     (for example: RLS violation, missing field, invalid JSON, etc.).
   - Do NOT guess; base this on the logged error.

4) Implement a minimal fix in client code only
   - If the problem is that user_id is null, fix how you get the current auth user id.
   - If the problem is a bad insert/update shape (wrong columns, wrong JSON type), fix the payload so it matches the existing profiles_v2 and account_prefs columns.
   - If the problem is that your code assumes quick_facts is always an object, add a safe default when it is null.
   - If the problem is that you are querying by the wrong field (e.g. mixing v1 profile id with Supabase auth id), fix the WHERE condition.

   IMPORTANT:
   - Do NOT change table names or column names.
   - Do NOT bypass RLS with a service key.
   - Only adjust how the React page calls Supabase and how it handles null/empty cases.

5) Clean up the logging
   - Once the page successfully:
     - loads my existing v2 profile, OR
     - creates one and then loads it
     without showing the “Error loading profile” box,
   - Remove the noisy console.log statements or reduce them to a single debug log.

6) Final summary
   - Tell me:
     - Which function was broken and why.
     - Which Supabase call failed and what the error was.
     - What exact code change you made to fix it.
   - Confirm that:
     - /settings/profile now loads my profile without error when I am logged in.
     - The public page /u/:handle still works.
     - Community feed and spotlight pages are unaffected.

Please work incrementally and avoid any large unrelated changes.
