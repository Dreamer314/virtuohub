Title: PLAN FIRST, WAIT FOR YES — Allow Supabase images via CSP

SCOPE
Touch only one of these, whichever actually defines CSP in this repo:
- server/index.ts  (if using helmet/contentSecurityPolicy)
- client/index.html or client/public/index.html  (if using a meta CSP tag)

Do not modify any other files. Do not add new files or packages. Keep diffs minimal.

GOAL
The Community feed <img> points to a Supabase public URL but the browser blocks it. We need to allow images from Supabase in the Content Security Policy.

FLOW
Step 1 — PLAN ONLY, no edits yet.
1) Search for CSP definitions:
   - Look for helmet import and contentSecurityPolicy usage in server/index.ts
   - Look for a meta tag: <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" ...> in the client index.html
2) Report exactly where CSP is set and paste the current directives.
3) Propose a minimal change that adds Supabase to image sources without weakening other directives:
   - If helmet: extend directives so img-src and media-src include "data:", "blob:", "https://*.supabase.co", "https://*.supabase.in"
   - If meta tag: update img-src and media-src similarly
4) Show unified diffs for the single file you will touch.
5) STOP and print: WAITING FOR YES

Step 2 — Only if I reply YES.
Apply exactly the proposed change. No other edits. Then print final diff and a short verification note.

TECH NOTES
- For helmet 6+:
  import helmet from "helmet";
  const defaults = helmet.contentSecurityPolicy.getDefaultDirectives();
  app.use(helmet({
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
      useDefaults: true,
      directives: {
        ...defaults,
        "img-src": ["'self'", "data:", "blob:", "https://*.supabase.co", "https://*.supabase.in"],
        "media-src": ["'self'", "data:", "blob:", "https://*.supabase.co", "https://*.supabase.in"],
        "connect-src": defaults["connect-src"] ? [...defaults["connect-src"], "https:", "wss:"] : ["'self'", "https:", "wss:"]
      }
    }
  }));
- For a meta tag, only update the img-src and media-src parts, leaving everything else intact.

After the change, I will hard refresh and test a post with one image.
