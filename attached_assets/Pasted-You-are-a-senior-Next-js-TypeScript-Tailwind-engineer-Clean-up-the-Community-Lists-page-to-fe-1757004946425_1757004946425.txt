You are a senior Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind engineer. Clean up the Community > Lists page to feel like a chart (not a dashboard). Use existing tokens and the three modes (light, dark, charcoal). Do not add new theme colors. Maintain accessibility.

CONTEXT: Problems to fix
- Charts show too many columns and colorful platform pills (visual noise).
- "Impact Score" and "Movement" columns distract from the core ranking.
- Platform metadata repeats across columns.
- The Filters chip row for the Lists grid is above the section header and the "Voice" chips don’t work.
- Platforms Index still looks like a dashboard table.

GOAL
Minimal, billboard-like charts: big rank, name, single concise platform label, optional compact meta. Move non-essential metrics to tooltips or hide. Make Lists grid filters live beneath the section heading or hide unused controls.

A) SIMPLIFY COLUMN SCHEMAS
Implement per-chart minimal schemas and remove row "movement" chips everywhere.

1) VHUB 100 (creators only)
  - Columns (in order): 
    • RANK (big number) 
    • CREATOR (avatar + name)
    • PLATFORM (single label: if multiple platforms → show “Cross-platform”)
  - Remove “Impact Score” column entirely.
  - Remove “Movement” column entirely.
  - Optional: a subtle muted secondary line under the name for short tagline if present (no metrics).
  - Keep voice mode (Editorial | Community Choice) as a header-level toggle only; do not show voice badges on rows.

2) Platforms Index (platforms only)
  - Columns:
    • RANK
    • PLATFORM (logo + name)
    • CATEGORY (e.g., Social, Sandbox, Engine)   // optional if we have it
  - Remove the “Creator Earnings Index” and “Movement” columns.
  - Do not render any voice UI for this tab.
  - No platform pills in this table—name + logo is sufficient.

3) Momentum 50 (creators only)
  - Columns:
    • RANK
    • CREATOR (avatar + name)
    • PLATFORM (single label as above, or “Cross-platform”)
  - Remove “30-day Growth” and “Movement” columns.
  - Keep a small “NEW” chip ONLY for first-timers (use the existing .vh-chip style, muted).

B) PLATFORM LABELING RULES
- For each row, determine a single display value:
  - If exactly one platform → show that platform name as small text (no colored pill).
  - If >1 → show “Cross-platform”.
- Remove the current multi-colored platform pills everywhere in charts.
- Keep the multi-pill style ONLY on **List Cards** (not in the charts table), using the subdued style already in the card component.

C) LISTS GRID: FILTERS & VOICE
- Move the Lists grid filters row **below** the “Featured Industry Lists” heading and subline.
- If “Voice” filters are not wired, remove them for now from the Lists grid. Keep only Sort and Platform filter there.
- Ensure the grid filters do not appear above the section heading.

D) HEADER & COPY CHECKS
- Keep the hero/header as is.
- Under the active tab, keep the one-liner definition.
- Remove any references to “Impact Score,” “Creator Earnings Index,” or “Movement” from labels and tooltips since we’re removing those columns.
- Retain the VHUB 100 Pro gate after Top 10; the gate copy stays intact.

E) STYLES / UTILITIES
- Reuse existing utilities. For platform text, create a tiny helper class:
  .vh-platform-label { @apply text-sm opacity-80; }
- For rank: keep .vh-rank (large, tabular-nums). For “NEW” chip, reuse .vh-chip with the low-contrast variant.

F) CLEANUP
- Delete unused column components and movement chip renderers not referenced after this change.
- Update unit tests and snapshots to match the minimal schemas:
  - VHUB 100 renders only Rank, Creator, Platform.
  - Platforms Index renders Rank, Platform, Category.
  - Momentum 50 renders Rank, Creator, Platform.
  - Lists grid filters render under the heading; no Voice chips in grid unless wired.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Charts feel minimal and scannable: big ranks, names, one platform label (or Cross-platform), optional NEW.
- No row-level “Impact Score” or “Movement” in any chart.
- Platforms Index lists platforms cleanly (no pills), with optional category.
- Lists grid shows its filters under the section heading; no dead Voice controls.
- Light/dark/charcoal modes remain consistent and accessible.
