Goal: Move all thread creation logic off the homepage. When a user clicks "Start a Thread" (or a category card), route to /community and auto-open the post composer there. The homepage should not render or import any composer code.

Keep component names and styles intact. Comment edits with // COMPOSER ROUTING.

1) Canonical compose trigger
Create a simple URL trigger that the Community page listens for:
- Query param: ?compose=true
- Optional preselect: &category=<slug> using the slugs from POST_CATEGORIES

Examples:
- /community?compose=true
- /community?compose=true&category=wip

2) Homepage changes
- Remove any composer imports and components from the homepage. Do not leave dead code.
- Primary button "Start a Thread" should call router.push("/community?compose=true")
- Category cards should be clickable and route to router.push(`/community?compose=true&category=${slug}`)
- Secondary button "Browse Community" should call router.push("/community")

3) Community page listener
On the Community page, auto-open the composer when compose=true is present:
- In a useEffect, read searchParams (App Router) or router.query (Pages Router)
- If compose === "true", call openComposer()
- If category is present and valid, preselect that category in the composer before opening

Pseudo (App Router):
"use client";
import { useSearchParams, useRouter } from "next/navigation";
useEffect(() => {
  const sp = useSearchParams();
  const shouldCompose = sp.get("compose") === "true";
  const cat = sp.get("category");
  if (shouldCompose) {
    if (cat && isValidCategory(cat)) setComposerCategory(cat);
    openComposer();
  }
}, []);

Helper:
import { POST_CATEGORIES } from "@/src/constants/postCategories";
function isValidCategory(slug: string) {
  return POST_CATEGORIES.some(c => c.slug === slug);
}

4) Close behavior and URL hygiene
- When the composer modal closes, strip the compose and category params from the URL without a full reload.
  - Use router.replace("/community", { scroll: false })
- Do not break back/forward history. Use replace only on close, not on open.

5) Accessibility
- Buttons must have aria-labels:
  - "Start a Thread" -> aria-label="Start a new thread"
  - "Browse Community" -> aria-label="Browse the community feed"
- Category cards rendered as buttons or links with keyboard activation and aria-label like:
  aria-label="Start a new thread in Work in Progress"

6) Type safety and state
- If using TypeScript, extend the composer open function to accept an optional category: openComposer(opts?: { category?: PostCategorySlug })
- Composer should accept a default category and reflect it in the UI

7) Acceptance checks
- Clicking "Start a Thread" on the homepage navigates to /community and opens the composer.
- Clicking a category card on the homepage navigates to /community, opens the composer, and shows that category preselected.
- The homepage does not import or render any composer code.
- Closing the composer on /community removes compose and category from the URL without reloading the page.
- Deep link test: Visiting /community?compose=true opens the composer even when arriving directly.
- No console errors. Types pass. Unused imports removed. Prettier run.

Optional: If both App and Pages Routers exist, prefer the current router in use and implement the appropriate hook imports.
