Refactor the current Featured section to a two-column carousel. Keep existing data but map it into a new FeaturedCarousel component. On desktop: image left, text right. On mobile: stack image above text. Use a fixed 16:9 frame with rounded corners and a subtle outer glow. Add arrow buttons and keyboard navigation. Keep dark theme, no inline styles, clean utility classes.

Accept this data shape:

type FeaturedItem = {
  id: string
  tag: 'News' | 'Creator Insights' | 'Spotlight' | 'Interview' | 'Tech'
  title: string
  blurb: string
  ctaLabel: string
  ctaHref: string
  imageSrc: string
  imageAlt: string
}


Map tags to pill styles:

News -> chip bg rgba(56,132,255,.12), text #6EA8FF, faint glow

Creator Insights -> bg rgba(120,255,214,.10), text #7AF3CF

Spotlight -> bg rgba(166,128,255,.12), text #C5A8FF

Interview -> bg rgba(104,220,255,.12), text #9BE3FF

Tech -> bg rgba(255,196,120,.10), text #FFC888

Image prompts for your generator

Tell it to create clean, glossy, cinematic game-world art in 16:9.

Maya Ortiz card
“Wide 16:9, cinematic glossy render of a neon city workshop in a virtual world. One creator at a curved ultrawide monitor with floating islands on screen. Cool blue and violet rim light, soft bloom, tidy desk, no text or logos.”

MetaHuman news
“16:9 studio portrait of a realistic digital human. Subtle pores, hair groom detail, neutral gradient background, cinematic key and rim lights, clean and glossy, no UI.”

Alex Chen interview
“16:9 glossy desk scene with twin monitors showing VR concept thumbnails and material swatches. Moody sci-fi lighting, gentle particles in air, clean reflections, no brands.”

Guardrails so the AI updates the current section

Keep the same section id or export name so routing and analytics still work.

Migrate any existing featured items into the new FeaturedItem shape.

If old data lacks tag values, default to “Spotlight.”

Preserve your autoplay and arrow controls if already present, but swap the layout.

Do not change global colors or spacing outside this section.
