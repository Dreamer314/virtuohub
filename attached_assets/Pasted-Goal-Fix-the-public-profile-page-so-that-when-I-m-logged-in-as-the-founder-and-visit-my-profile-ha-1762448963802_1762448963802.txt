Goal
Fix the public profile page so that when I’m logged in as the founder and visit my profile (handle: Founder), it correctly loads my profile instead of “Profile not found”.

Current facts
- My auth user:
  - email: thevirtuohub@gmail.com
  - user_id: 047d3bb2-a023-4465-83f2-97559fc9054b
- profiles_v2 row for this user:
  - handle: 'Founder'
  - kind: 'ADMIN'
  - visibility: 'PUBLIC'
- The error shown is: “The profile @Founder does not exist or you don’t have permission to view it.”

Constraints
- Do NOT change database schema or RLS.
- Do NOT modify other features.
- Only touch:
  - the public profile page/component (likely public-profile.tsx or similar)
  - any profile lookup hook it uses.

Tasks

1) Inspect the public profile loader
- Find the page/component that shows the “Profile not found” card.
- Identify:
  - what route param it receives (handle or slug)
  - which table it queries (`profiles_v2` or something else)
  - all conditions used (handle, visibility, hasValidProfile, etc.).

2) Make it use profiles_v2 correctly
- Ensure the query is against `profiles_v2` by handle.
- Ensure the handle comparison matches what’s in the DB:
  - If it lowercases the slug, also lowercase the handle in the query (or use ILIKE).
- Make sure the visibility / access check allows:
  - visibility = 'PUBLIC'
  - and, for the logged-in owner, always allow viewing their own profile even if some flag is false.

3) Link from header / user menu
- Ensure the “View profile” link for the logged-in user uses:
  - the handle from `useMyV2Profile` (which reads from `profiles_v2`)
  - not any legacy tables.
- So for me it should point to whatever URL the public profile page expects for handle 'Founder'.

4) Testing
- Logged in as the founder:
  - Click “View profile” in header / user menu.
  - Confirm it navigates to my profile and shows my data, not “Profile not found.”
- Logged in as another user:
  - Visiting `/@Founder` should show my public profile (since visibility = 'PUBLIC'), not 404.

5) Summary
- In your final summary, tell me:
  - Which file controls the public profile page.
  - What query/conditions it now uses to load a profile.
  - How it handles case sensitivity for handles and visibility.
