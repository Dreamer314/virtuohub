I want to refine the Post a Job flow and the jobs data model to better match the immersive creator economy.

Please make the following changes. Work only in the jobs / talent area – don’t touch unrelated pages.

1) Remove “Remote friendly” from the UI (but keep the column)

Goal: All VirtuoHub jobs are effectively remote by default, so the checkbox is noise.

In the Post Job page (client/src/pages/jobs/new.tsx or equivalent):

Remove the “Remote friendly” checkbox from the form.

Remove any form state / validation for isRemote / is_remote.

In the Find Work job cards (client/src/pages/talent.tsx or wherever the cards are rendered):

Remove the “Remote” pill / badge from the card UI.

In the Job Detail page (client/src/pages/job-detail.tsx):

Remove any “Remote” pill / text.

Important:

Do NOT drop the is_remote column from the public.jobs table.

It can remain in the database and TypeScript types, just unused in the UI for now.

2) Make Budget / Rate structured (payment type + currency + amount)

Right now the job form has a single “Budget / Rate” text field. Replace it with a structured group of three fields.

2a) Database schema

Update the public.jobs table (in Supabase) to add two new columns:

ALTER TABLE public.jobs
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS payment_type text,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS currency text;


Set reasonable defaults for existing rows (optional but ideal):

UPDATE public.jobs
SET payment_type = COALESCE(payment_type, 'Per project'),
    currency     = COALESCE(currency, 'USD');


Do not remove the existing budget/budget_text column — we will continue to use it for the numeric amount.

Also update the TypeScript / Drizzle schema for the jobs table so it includes:

payment_type: string | null

currency: string | null

(Use the same naming as in the DB: payment_type, currency.)

2b) Post Job form UI

On the Post Job page, replace the current single “Budget / Rate” field with:

Payment type (dropdown)

Label: Payment type *

Options (exact text):

Per project

Per hour

Per asset

Revenue share

Other

Currency (dropdown)

Label: Currency *

Options:

USD

Linden Dollar (L$)

Robux

Other

Amount (text input)

Label: Budget / rate *

Placeholder:
e.g. 50 or 25/hr
(Use a low-to-mid example like this; do not use 1500.)

Helper text under the field:
Rough ranges are fine (e.g. 50, 25/hr). This just helps creators see if it’s a fit.

Wire these three fields into the form state and submission so that:

payment_type is saved to the new payment_type column.

currency is saved to the new currency column.

The numeric / free-text amount goes into the existing budget field (whatever it’s currently named in the jobs table and schema).

Validation:

All three should be required for now.

2c) Display on Find Work cards

On the Find Work tab job cards:

Replace the current budget display with something like:

Budget: 50 USD, Per project

That is:

Show budget amount

Followed by currency

Followed by payment_type (comma-separated)

Handle missing data gracefully (e.g. if currency is null, just show the amount).

2d) Display on Job Detail page

On /jobs/:id:

In the main info section, show a clear Budget row:

Label: Budget

Value: 50 USD, Per project (same formatting as cards)

If any of the three fields are missing, degrade gracefully instead of crashing.

3) Keep everything else as-is

Do not change any routing or RLS logic.

Do not change how jobs are filtered on the Find Work tab.

Keep the “Contact / Apply” button disabled / “Coming soon” as it is now.

When you’re done:

Create a test job with:

Payment type: Per project

Currency: USD

Budget: 50

Confirm:

The Post Job form submits successfully.

The job card on Find Work shows “Budget: 50 USD, Per project”.

The Job detail page shows the same budget info.

The “Remote” checkbox and pill are gone everywhere.

Use this exact spec; please don’t invent additional fields or flows.
