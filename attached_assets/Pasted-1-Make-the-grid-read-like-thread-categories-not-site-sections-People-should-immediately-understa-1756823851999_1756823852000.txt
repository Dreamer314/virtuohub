1) Make the grid read like thread categories (not site sections)

People should immediately understand “these are the places I can post.” Use the labels your community already uses and add General.

Categories (Row 1)

How it behaves

Browse goes to /community?tag=<tag>.

Start a thread opens the compose modal with that tag preselected.

These tags should also be added to your posting form’s category list.

2) Put Editorial & Data in a separate row

These aren’t thread categories; they are full pages and feeds you publish or curate. Listing them together clarifies the difference.

Editorial & Data (Row 2)

Creator Spotlights → /spotlights
Read button only.

Interviews → /interviews
Read button only.

Tips & Guides → /guides
Read button only.

Industry News → /news
Read button only.

Trending → /trending
Explore button only.

Upcoming Events → /events
View schedule button only.

Pulse Reports → /pulse
Explore button only.

This list matches your sidebar and the pages your featured carousel can link to. It keeps the mental model consistent.
