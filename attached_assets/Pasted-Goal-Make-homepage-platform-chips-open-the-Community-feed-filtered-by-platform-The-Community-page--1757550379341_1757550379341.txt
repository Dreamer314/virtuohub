Goal: Make homepage platform chips open the Community feed filtered by platform. The Community page should read ?platform=<slug>, apply the filter, highlight the active item in the sidebar, and support clearing the filter. Remove all extra logic from the homepage; filtering belongs on the Community page.

1) Platform constants
- Create src/constants/platforms.ts with:
export const PLATFORMS = [
  { label: "Roblox", slug: "roblox" },
  { label: "VRChat", slug: "vrchat" },
  { label: "Second Life", slug: "second-life" },
  { label: "IMVU", slug: "imvu" },
  { label: "Meta Horizon Worlds", slug: "horizon" },
  { label: "Unity", slug: "unity" },
  { label: "Unreal Engine", slug: "unreal" },
  { label: "Core", slug: "core" },
  { label: "Dreams", slug: "dreams" },
  { label: "Fortnite Creative", slug: "fortnite" },
  { label: "Minecraft", slug: "minecraft" },
  { label: "GTA FiveM", slug: "fivem" },
  { label: "The Sims", slug: "sims" },
  { label: "inZOI", slug: "inzoi" },
  { label: "Elder Scrolls Online", slug: "eso" },
  { label: "Fallout", slug: "fallout" },
  { label: "Counter-Strike", slug: "cs" },
  { label: "Team Fortress 2", slug: "tf2" },
  { label: "Other Platform", slug: "other" }
];

2) Homepage chips
- Each chip should route to /community?platform=<slug>.
- Chips are buttons or links with aria-label="Filter community by <label>".

3) Community page
- On mount, read const platform = searchParams.get("platform").
- If it matches a valid slug, set local filterPlatform state and apply it to the feed query.
- Update the sidebar to highlight the active platform item.

4) Sidebar integration
- Sidebar items come from PLATFORMS.
- Active item gets bold text and primary icon color.
- Clicking an item updates filterPlatform and pushes /community?platform=<slug>.
- Add “Clear filter” item at the top when a filter is active. Clicking clears state and resets URL to /community.

5) Feed query
- Accept optional platform param in feed hook or API call.
- When present, filter posts by platform. If not yet implemented in backend, filter client-side temporarily.

6) Empty state
- If filter returns no posts, show:
  Title: "No posts yet for {platform label}"
  Subtitle: "Be the first to start a thread for this platform."
  Button: "Start a Thread" → /community?compose=true&platform=<slug>

7) Accessibility
- Sidebar active item has aria-current="true".
- Empty state button aria-label="Start a new thread for {label}".

8) Acceptance checks
- Clicking a homepage chip navigates to /community?platform=<slug>, highlights that sidebar item, and filters feed.
- Sidebar item clicks update URL and feed.
- Clear filter resets URL and feed.
- Visiting /community?platform=roblox directly loads filtered feed.
- No console errors. Prettier run. Unused imports removed.
