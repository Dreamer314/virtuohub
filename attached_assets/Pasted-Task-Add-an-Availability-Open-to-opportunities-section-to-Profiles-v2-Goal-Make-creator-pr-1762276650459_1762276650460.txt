Task: Add an "Availability / Open to opportunities" section to Profiles v2.

Goal
Make creator profiles feel more like the start of a talent marketplace by adding:
- "Open to work" and "Hiring" toggles
- A short free-text note about opportunities
These should be stored on profiles_v2 and exposed in both profile settings and the public profile page.

Hard rules
- Use ONLY the existing profiles_v2 table as the profile source of truth.
- No new tables. Just add columns to profiles_v2 via the existing Drizzle schema and db:push.
- Do NOT touch legacy v1 profile tables or onboarding flows.
- Do NOT remove or rename any existing columns.
- Keep Typescript types in sync.

Database changes (profiles_v2)
1) Update the Drizzle schema definition for profiles_v2 (shared/schema.profilesV2.ts or wherever it lives) to add:

- isOpenToWork: boolean, default false, NOT NULL
- isHiring: boolean, default false, NOT NULL
- availabilityNote: text, nullable

Name the underlying SQL columns:

- is_open_to_work  (boolean, default false)
- is_hiring        (boolean, default false)
- availability_note (text)

2) Run the appropriate migration / push (npm run db:push or equivalent) so these columns exist in the database.

3) Verify with a SQL query in Supabase that profiles_v2 now has:
- is_open_to_work boolean
- is_hiring boolean
- availability_note text

Profile settings UI (/settings/profile)
File: client/src/pages/profile-settings.tsx

1) Extend the TS type you use for the profile (e.g. MyProfileV2 or similar) to include:
- is_open_to_work: boolean
- is_hiring: boolean
- availability_note: string | null

2) When loading the profile from Supabase, select these new fields as well.

3) In the form state, initialize them with safe defaults:
- is_open_to_work: profile?.is_open_to_work ?? false
- is_hiring: profile?.is_hiring ?? false
- availability_note: profile?.availability_note ?? ''

4) In the JSX, below the existing Bio textarea, add a new section:

- Heading: "Availability"
- Checkbox:
  - Label: "I’m open to paid opportunities"
  - Bound to is_open_to_work
- Checkbox:
  - Label: "I’m looking to hire creators"
  - Bound to is_hiring
- Textarea:
  - Label: "Availability details"
  - Placeholder: "What kinds of work, collaboration, or roles are you open to?"
  - Bound to availability_note

5) Update the "Save Changes" mutation so it includes these new fields in the UPDATE on profiles_v2:
- is_open_to_work
- is_hiring
- availability_note

Make sure they are actually persisted.

Public profile UI (/u/:handle)
File: client/src/pages/public-profile.tsx

1) Ensure the profile query selects:
- is_open_to_work
- is_hiring
- availability_note

2) Under the headline (where the name and handle are), render status pills if needed:
- If profile.is_open_to_work: show a small pill, e.g. "Open to opportunities"
- If profile.is_hiring: show a pill, e.g. "Hiring creators"

Use the existing badge / pill styles already in the project if there are any. Otherwise a simple rounded badge is fine.

3) Below the About section, conditionally render an "Opportunities" card:

- Only show this card if availability_note is non-empty.
- Content:

  Title: "Opportunities"
  Body: the availability_note text.

No card at all if availability_note is null or empty.

General
- Do not break existing profile functionality (headline, bio/about, avatar, etc.).
- Keep the new fields optional and additive.
- Use existing design language (shadows, rounded corners, typography) so it looks native to the app.

Testing checklist (please actually run this)
1) Log in as my existing user and go to /settings/profile.
2) Set:
   - Open to paid opportunities = checked
   - Looking to hire creators = checked
   - Availability details = some sample text
   Click Save Changes and confirm the toast.
3) Refresh /settings/profile and confirm the values are persisted.
4) Go to /u/<my-handle>:
   - Verify the pills "Open to opportunities" and "Hiring creators" show under the headline.
   - Verify an "Opportunities" section appears and shows the text.
5) Turn off both checkboxes, clear availability details, save again, then refresh:
   - No pills under the headline.
   - No "Opportunities" section.

Finally, summarize which files you changed and the final database schema for profiles_v2.
