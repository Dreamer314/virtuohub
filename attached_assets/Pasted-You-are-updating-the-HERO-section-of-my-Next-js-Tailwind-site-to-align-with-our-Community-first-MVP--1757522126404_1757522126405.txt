You are updating the HERO section of my Next.js/Tailwind site to align with our Community-first MVP. Make only the changes listed. Do not rename components or break existing styles. Keep code clean, commented, and accessible.

1) HERO COPY
- Headline text (H1, Orbitron): 
  "VirtuoHub: The HQ for creators building the future of immersive games and virtual worlds."
- Subhead text (paragraph under H1):
  "Your community for news, insights, and connection across the immersive creator economy. From Roblox and GTA to Sims and Second Life, join the conversation shaping what’s next in virtual worlds."
- Primary CTA button label: "Join the Community"
- Secondary CTA button label: "Watch Demo"
- Microcopy below buttons:
  "Start free and connect with creators across the immersive economy today."
- Search placeholder should read: "Search posts, creators, or tags"

2) HERO VISUALS AND HIERARCHY
- Add a subtle bottom-to-center dark gradient overlay on the hero image so text passes WCAG contrast. Implement via a before pseudo-element or an absolutely positioned div with opacity, not by editing the image.
- Make primary CTA visually dominant: filled style using brand neon-blue glow, larger shadow, hover scale 1.02. Secondary CTA should be outline style with the same radius and padding.
- Keep rounded hero container and existing drop shadow.

3) TYPOGRAPHY AND SPACING
- Ensure H1 uses Orbitron at a larger size on desktop (e.g., text-5xl md:text-6xl) and tight line-height for two-line lockup.
- Subhead uses readable max-w (e.g., max-w-3xl) and slightly increased leading.
- Maintain consistent vertical rhythm across breakpoints.

4) ACCESSIBILITY
- H1 remains the first and only H1 on the page.
- Buttons have aria-labels: 
  Primary -> aria-label="Join the VirtuoHub community"
  Secondary -> aria-label="Watch the VirtuoHub demo"
- Search input has label for screen readers and role="search".

5) IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Do not change routing. Primary CTA links to the Community page route. Secondary CTA links to the demo route.
- Add comments near updated lines: // HERO updated per community-first MVP
- Run Prettier and remove unused imports.

6) ACCEPTANCE CHECKS (add a temporary console report after build)
- Text matches exactly as provided above.
- Primary CTA is visually stronger than secondary.
- Search placeholder updated.
- Contrast passes with overlay enabled.
- No layout shift on mobile widths 360, 390, 414, 768, 1024.
