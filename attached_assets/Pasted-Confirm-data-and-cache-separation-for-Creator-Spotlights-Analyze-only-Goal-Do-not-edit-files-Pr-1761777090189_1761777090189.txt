Confirm data and cache separation for Creator Spotlights. Analyze only.

Goal: Do not edit files. Produce a short report that confirms whether the Spotlights page is coupled to Community via cache, schema, and filters. List exact files, lines, and props involved.

Questions to answer with file paths and line refs:

Query key reuse

Where is useQuery with key ['/api/posts'] defined on the Spotlights page.

Where else is the same key used in Community. Confirm that React Query would share the cache between the two pages.

Data fetcher

Show the function that services '/api/posts'. Confirm it hits supabase.from('posts') and returns all posts without server-side subtype='spotlight' filtering.

If there is any select or contains on tags, list it.

Client-side filtering

Point to the lines that filter post.subtype === 'spotlight'. Note any additional filters applied from useFilterStore.

Filter store coupling

Identify where useFilterStore and useURLFilters are imported on the Spotlights page. List which filter keys are read or written. Confirm whether those keys are the same as Community’s.

State whether opening Community and changing filters can change the Spotlights results.

Card component

Confirm the exact import and usage of PostCard on the Spotlights page. Show file and lines.

Verify whether a SpotlightCard or equivalent exists. If not, note that.

Routes

List the exact route paths for Community detail and Spotlight detail pages from the router config. Confirm there is no collision.

Confirm that “View Full Spotlight” buttons point to the Spotlight detail route.

Tagline placement

Locate the markup that prints “Showing X spotlights | Clear filters.”

Confirm there is also a static tagline element “Profiles of creators, studios, and brands shaping the space.” If it exists, note its position in the tree. If it does not, note absence.

Deliverable:
A concise report with:

Confirmation of cache reuse and its impact.

Confirmation of schema coupling and whether editors can publish subtype:'spotlight' from Community.

Exact lines to remove or replace later: the PostCard map, the count header, and the filter store usage.

A minimal “future fix plan,” no code edits, describing:

use dedicated query key ['spotlights'] and server-side subtype='spotlight' filter or a spotlights table,

swap PostCard for a Spotlight-specific card,

remove the feed count header and keep the static tagline under the page title,

decouple from useFilterStore or create a namespaced useSpotlightFilters.

Constraints:

Analysis only. No file writes. No refactors. Cite files and line numbers.
