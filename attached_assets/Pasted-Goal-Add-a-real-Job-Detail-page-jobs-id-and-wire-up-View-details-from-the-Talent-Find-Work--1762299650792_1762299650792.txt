Goal: Add a real Job Detail page (/jobs/:id) and wire up “View details” from the Talent → Find Work tab.

Right now:

/talent exists with tabs Find Talent and Find Work.

The Find Work tab shows job cards from the jobs table, including a “View details” button that currently doesn’t navigate anywhere.

The jobs table already exists in Supabase with columns like:

id (uuid, PK)

user_id

title

company_name

primary_skill

platform

job_type

budget_text

is_remote

location

description

visibility (PUBLIC / DRAFT, etc.)

created_at

RLS is already configured so public jobs (visibility = 'PUBLIC') should be viewable.

Please implement the following:

1. Create Job Detail route: /jobs/:id

Add a new page component, e.g. client/src/pages/job-detail.tsx (or whatever naming matches the existing pattern).

Register a new route in client/src/App.tsx (or the central router file):

Path: /jobs/:id

Component: Job detail page

The job detail page should:

Use the global layout:

VirtuoHub header at the top

Footer at the bottom

main content in the middle with max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-10 (similar to the public profile page).

Read the id param from the URL.

Fetch the job from Supabase:

Table: jobs

Filter:

id = :id

visibility = 'PUBLIC'

No user_id filter (this page must be publicly viewable).

Handle states:

Loading: show a centered loading state.

Not found / unauthorized: show a friendly “Job not found or no longer available” message.

Render a single card-style job layout with:

Job title (big, at top)

Company / Studio name

Pill row: Skill Required, Platform, Job Type, Remote (if is_remote true), Location (if present)

Budget line (e.g. “Budget: $50” or whatever budget_text is)

Posted date (“Posted on …”) from created_at

Full description (multi-line, uses the description field)

Add a primary CTA button:

Label: “Contact / Apply”

For v1, you can use a simple mailto: if an email field already exists on the job or the posting user, OR just make it a disabled button with a tooltip “Coming soon” if no obvious field exists yet.

Do not build a full application workflow yet.

2. Wire up “View details” buttons from /talent?tab=work

In client/src/pages/talent.tsx (or wherever the Find Work tab lives):

Update the View details button on each job card so that it:

Navigates to /jobs/:id?from=talent_work (use the job’s id).

Use the existing navigation helper (e.g. useNavigate() from React Router).

Keep all existing job filters and card UI intact.

3. Back navigation behavior

On the job detail page:

At the top of the content (just under the header), add a breadcrumb-style link:

Text: ← Back to Find Work

Behavior:

If the URL has from=talent_work, clicking it should navigate back to /talent?tab=work.

If from is missing, still fall back to /talent?tab=work (so direct visits have a sensible back target).

Use the same visual style as the “Back to VirtuoHub” link on the public profile page, but with the updated text.

4. Visibility & security

Ensure the job detail Supabase query:

Does not filter by user_id at all.

Filters by:

id = :id

visibility = 'PUBLIC'

Assume RLS is already set to allow public SELECT of jobs with visibility = 'PUBLIC'. Do not add any new user-specific filtering here.

5. Sanity checks

Please verify the following scenarios:

Anonymous user (logged out)

Navigate to /talent?tab=work:

See the list of public jobs.

Click “View details” on a job → land on /jobs/:id?from=talent_work.

See full job detail.

Click ← Back to Find Work → returns to /talent?tab=work with filters reset to default.

Logged-in user (job poster or not)

Same as above: they should see all public jobs, not just their own.

Detail page and back link behave exactly the same.

Non-public job

If a job has visibility != 'PUBLIC', direct navigation to /jobs/:id should show the “Job not found or no longer available” state, regardless of login state (v1 behavior is fine).

Please keep all existing Talent directory behavior (profiles, filters, etc.) unchanged; we’re only adding the job detail route and wiring up the existing “View details” button.
