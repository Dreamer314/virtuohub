Recreate the “Your Community Awaits” block from the provided mock exactly on the homepage, reusing the Community page’s card and theme system so visuals stay cohesive across light, dark, and charcoal modes.

Design constraints

Reuse the Community page Card component and theme tokens. Do not create new shadows or spacings.

Card visuals must be identical to Community page in all modes: same radius, shadow, border, inner lighting, padding, hover.

Section titles must use the Community title treatment: short horizontal lines flanking the title with a small icon to the left of the text.

Icons in the “Your creativity should pay you back” list use the same 4 gradient specs already used on the Community page buttons. Apply the gradients to the icon fills for depth.

Ambient background: soft vignette behind the right column list and the “We built what we needed” callouts. No hard seams at the bottom. If a bottom seam appears, move the glow to a centered radial behind content and feather outward.

Typography, spacing scale, and breakpoints must match Community page tokens. No hardcoded colors or ad-hoc sizes.

Structure to build

Section wrapper with max-width matching Community page container and same vertical rhythm tokens.

H1: “Your Community Awaits.” with subhead paragraph below.

Brand row: inline list of the platforms above, styled as small monochrome marks with uniform opacity and equal spacing. If logos are unavailable, render text labels with tracking and reduced opacity.

Two-column body:
Left column
• H2: “You don’t have to be a pro to begin”
• Short paragraph
• Side-by-side image cards: left = wireframe head, right = stylized avatar head, each inside a Card with identical styling to Community page
• Small captions under each image card: “Day 1” and “Week 4” with brief lines as shown
• “What you’ll get” bullet list using Community page check bullets
Right column
• H2: “Your creativity should pay you back”
• Three stacked clickable cards using the Card component with icon + label:
Sell avatars, 3D models, and digital assets
Build and monetize virtual experiences
Teach others through workshops and courses
Icons use the 4 button gradients from Community page
• Subsection H2: “We built what we needed” with three quote callouts, each a small Card or subtle surface using the same token scale

CTA band at the bottom: “The industry is changing fast” with a short sentence and right-aligned primary button “Start Your Journey”. Use the same CTA component style from Community page.

Implementation notes

Import and use the exact Card component and theme tokens from Community page. If the homepage has its own variant, refactor to a shared component and import it.

Title treatment helper: build a small TitleWithRule component that renders the left icon, the text, and the horizontal rules using the same spacing and line weight as Community.

Icon gradients: read the 4 gradient tokens used for the Community buttons and apply them to the SVG icons via fill or a referenced gradient id.

Ambient: implement a single radial gradient background layer behind the right column content with opacity tokens so it feathers on all breakpoints.

Accessibility: maintain Community page contrast ratios, focus states on interactive cards, and hide decorative icons from screen readers.

Acceptance criteria

Pixel-parity card styling with Community page across light, dark, charcoal.

Titles use the exact rule + icon treatment and spacing from Community page.

Icon gradients match the 4 button gradients.

No visible ambient seams at common widths.

Mobile, tablet, desktop breakpoints match Community page rhythm.

No duplicated CSS or inline colors; all styles come from shared tokens or the Card component.
