Goal:
Extend the existing My Profile → Profile settings page with a new “Creator Profile” section that captures marketplace-style info (skills, platforms, tools, portfolio, socials), without touching the marketplace / directory UI yet.
Use the existing Supabase profiles_v2 table.
Important: store all new creator-profile fields inside the existing quick_facts JSONB column so we don’t need new migrations or columns. Existing fields like headline, about, is_open_to_work, is_hiring, availability_note must keep working as they are now.

1. Data model (inside profiles_v2.quick_facts)
Use this structure (all keys optional):
{
  "primary_role": "3D Modeler",
  "secondary_roles": ["Rigger", "Texture Artist"],
  "platforms": ["Second Life", "VRChat", "The Sims (CC)"],
  "tools": ["Blender", "Photoshop"],
  "experience_level": "3–5 years",
  "portfolio_url": "https://…",
  "social_links": {
    "website": "https://…",
    "twitter": "https://twitter.com/…",
    "instagram": "https://instagram.com/…",
    "artstation": "https://…",
    "discord": "name#0001"
  }
}

When saving, merge into quick_facts rather than overwriting everything, to avoid losing unknown keys:
const updatedQuickFacts = {
  ...(existingQuickFacts ?? {}),
  primary_role,
  secondary_roles,
  platforms,
  tools,
  experience_level,
  portfolio_url,
  social_links: {
    ...(existingQuickFacts?.social_links ?? {}),
    website,
    twitter,
    instagram,
    artstation,
    discord,
  },
};

Then include quick_facts: updatedQuickFacts in the update call for profiles_v2.

2. UI placement
File to edit: client/src/pages/profile-settings.tsx
On the My Profile settings page:


Keep the existing sections as they are:


Display Name


Headline


Handle (read-only)


Profile Picture upload


Bio


Availability toggles (is_open_to_work, is_hiring, availability_note) – these already work, don’t break them.




Below the existing sections, add a new card titled “Creator Profile”.


Use the same visual style as other settings cards (rounded card, section title, helper text).

3. Fields in “Creator Profile”
3.1 Primary Skill / Role (required)


Label: Primary Skill


Type: single-select dropdown or pill group.


Options (predefined list):


3D Modeler


World Builder


Environment Artist


Character Artist


Rigger


Animator


Scripter / Programmer


Technical Artist


UI / UX Designer


Sound Designer


Video Editor


Community Manager




Include an “Other…” option:


When selected, show a small text input.


User types a custom role and presses Enter.


Save that string as quick_facts.primary_role.


In the UI, display the custom value as the selected role.




3.2 Other Skills (optional)


Label: Other Skills


Type: multi-select chips using the same list as Primary Skill.


Behavior:


User can toggle multiple chips on/off.


Include an “Other +” chip.


Clicking it shows a small text input.


On Enter, create a new pill with that label and add to secondary_roles.






Save as quick_facts.secondary_roles: string[].


3.3 Platforms


Label: Platforms you work on


Type: multi-select chips.


Predefined options:


Roblox


VRChat


Second Life


IMVU


Meta Horizon Worlds


GTA / FiveM


The Sims (CC)


Unity


Unreal Engine




“Other” behavior (important):


Show an “Other +” chip.


Clicking it opens a small text input.


When the user types a custom platform and hits Enter:


Add a chip with that text.


Store it as a normal string in the array.






Save as quick_facts.platforms: string[].


3.4 Tools


Label: Tools you use


Type: multi-select chips.


Predefined options (we can add more later, but start with):


Blender


Maya


ZBrush


Substance Painter


Photoshop


Marvelous Designer


Unity


Unreal Engine


Notepad++


VS Code


Udon / UdonSharp




Same “Other +” → input → pill behavior as Platforms.


Save as quick_facts.tools: string[].


3.5 Experience


Label: Experience level


Type: single-select dropdown.


Options:


New / < 1 year


1–3 years


3–5 years


5+ years




Save selection as quick_facts.experience_level: string.


3.6 Portfolio and socials
In the same card, under a subheading like “Portfolio & Socials”, add:


Portfolio / website


Placeholder: https://…


Save as quick_facts.portfolio_url.




Twitter / X → quick_facts.social_links.twitter


Instagram → quick_facts.social_links.instagram


ArtStation → quick_facts.social_links.artstation


Discord (free text, can be link or handle) → quick_facts.social_links.discord


All optional. Simple text inputs; no heavy validation, just trim and ensure empty strings become null or are omitted.

4. Loading & saving behavior


When the settings page loads, fetch the current profile (which it already does) and:


Read quick_facts from the profile row.


Parse it as an object and initialize the new form fields from it.


Handle the case where quick_facts is null or missing keys.




On Save Changes:


Keep the existing save behavior for display_name, headline, about, avatar, availability, etc.


Extend the payload to include updated quick_facts as described above.




Ensure the Save button disabled / loading states still behave correctly (no double submits).


Do not modify public profile layout yet (other than whatever is already implemented for availability chips like “Hiring creators”).



5. UI polish


Use the same input components and styling that the page already uses (so it matches VirtuoHub’s look).


Chips / pills should:


Show an active state when selected.


Be removable for multi-select fields (little “x” on the chip).




Custom “Other” entries should look identical to predefined chips once added.



In summary:
Add a “Creator Profile” card to profile-settings.tsx that reads/writes the structured creator data into profiles_v2.quick_facts as described. Don’t add new DB columns, don’t touch marketplace browsing yet, and don’t break existing profile/availability behavior.
