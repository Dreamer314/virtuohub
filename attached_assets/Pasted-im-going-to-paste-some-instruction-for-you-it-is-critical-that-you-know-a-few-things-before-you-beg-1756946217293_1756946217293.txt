im going to paste some instruction for you, it is critical that you know a few things before you begin implementing these changes.

Vhub Pulse & Polls created by users via the thread are NOT tied together. these are two separate things, vhub pulse section on the community page is not to be touched modified or edited. neither is anything on the pulse reports page.

you are not to modify anything except the community feed section on the community page, meaning the reddit style thread we have already created that is below the title community feed on the community page.

You are to check your work and ensure this functions as a full system once completed and fix any errors, also remove any data that is no longer needed and clean up after the changes to ensure the code stays as organized and clean as possible

Other than that, follow the pasted goal text.



CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES:

When implementing the split composer system for the community feed section, you must:

DO NOT TOUCH:

The VHub header image and title with effects at the top of the page
Any existing styling, layouts, or visual elements outside the community feed
The VHub Pulse section (keep it exactly as it is)
The pulse reports page (user polls should NOT appear there)
Any existing post card components or their styling
The overall page structure, sidebars, or navigation
ONLY MODIFY:

The community feed section below the "Community Feed" title
Add two separate buttons: "Create Post" and "Create Poll"
Create two separate modal components with different fields
Use the existing post data structure without breaking anything
REQUIREMENTS:

User-created polls stay in community feed only, NOT in pulse reports
VHub Pulse and user polls are completely separate systems
Maintain all existing functionality and styling
Fix any console errors without changing existing components
Test thoroughly before marking complete
APPROACH:

Read existing code first to understand the current structure
Make minimal, targeted changes only to the community feed section
Preserve all existing styling and layout
Keep the beautiful header image and effects exactly as they are
