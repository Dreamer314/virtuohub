“Update the Featured Content carousel to a two-column layout: image on the left, text on the right for desktop. Stack vertically on mobile. Use a fixed 16:9 media frame with soft rounded corners and a subtle glow shadow. Preserve my dark theme. For each slide, insert:

category tag chip

H2 title

short blurb (max 35 words)

primary button CTA

Add keyboard and ARIA support. Add gentle 300 ms fade when slides change. Keep code clean and commented. No inline styles. Use utility classes. Ensure images use object-cover and lazy-load.”

Quick design notes

Pad the text column so the headline aligns vertically with the center of the image.

Use a soft radial glow behind the image frame to echo the Unreal vibe.

Keep tag chips consistent: pill, tiny glow, low contrast until hover.
