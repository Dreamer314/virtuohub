Clean and organize the codebase

Goal: make the code clean, consistent, and easy to maintain. Do not add features. Do not change visual design or behavior.

Do these steps in order:

Format all files with Prettier defaults.

Fix ESLint warnings and errors. Remove unused imports, variables, and dead code.

Standardize naming. Functions and files use clear verbs and nouns. No abbreviations that hide meaning.

Split oversized files. Any file over 200 lines or any function over 40 lines gets extracted into helpers.

Centralize constants, types, and shared helpers in a small lib or utils folder.

Check imports. Use one import style and collapse duplicates. Use relative paths only where needed.

Stabilize public APIs. Keep component props and exported function signatures the same unless they are clearly broken.

Tighten state and props. Remove unused state. Avoid prop drilling by extracting small context or helper where obvious.

Accessibility pass. Interactive elements use semantic tags, focus states, labels or aria labels, and proper roles.

CSS pass. Remove unused classes. Avoid deep selectors. Keep spacing and color tokens consistent. No layout changes.

Error handling. Replace silent failures with clear user-safe messages. No raw console.log in production paths.

Security skim. No eval. Sanitize or escape user content. Never log secrets.

Performance skim. Memoize obvious heavy computations. Avoid re-creating handlers in render if not needed.

Remove leftover debug code, TODOs that are obsolete, and commented-out blocks.

Add one tiny test or example per public helper, or inline usage docs if tests do not exist.

Verify build runs without warnings. If warnings remain, list them with reasons.

Acceptance checks:

npm run lint and npm run build succeed.

No unused imports. No unreachable code.

No console errors in the browser.

UI looks the same on desktop and mobile.

All interactive elements work with keyboard.

README contains a short “How to run” section if missing.

Rules:

No new dependencies unless required to fix a clear error.

No large renames that break imports.

Keep comments brief and useful at the top of files and complex functions.
