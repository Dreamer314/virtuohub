I want to start using Profiles v2 in the UI.

Do not change any database schema. Use the existing v2 tables and RLS.  
Do not remove or break any v1 behavior. The rest of the app must keep working.

GOAL  
Create a basic but real profile experience backed by profiles_v2:

1) A public profile page that anyone can view  
2) A "My profile" settings page that the logged in user can edit  
3) Simple navigation so I can reach my profile from the top bar

DATA TO USE  

Profiles v2 table: public.profiles_v2  
Important columns:
- profile_id (primary key)
- user_id (owner, matches auth user id)
- handle (unique)
- display_name
- profile_photo_url
- visibility
- quick_facts (JSON, use a "bio" key inside this for now)

Account prefs table: public.account_prefs
- user_id
- last_active_profile_id (points to profiles_v2.profile_id)

Do not change these tables or their policies. Only read and update rows through Supabase.

PART 1: Public profile page /u/:handle

1) Add a route like /u/:handle using the existing router in this project.
2) On that page:
   - Look up the profile by handle in profiles_v2.
   - Respect RLS. Only show profiles the current anon or user can read.
   - Show:
     - avatar from profile_photo_url (with a safe default if null)
     - display_name (fallback to handle if missing)
     - @handle
     - bio text from quick_facts.bio if present, otherwise a short placeholder like:
       "This creator has not added a bio yet."
   - If no profile is found or RLS forbids it, show a friendly "Profile not found" state.
3) Keep styling consistent with the rest of the app (same fonts, spacing, card style).

PART 2: "My profile" settings page

1) Add a "My profile" page, for example at /settings/profile or similar.
   Reuse any existing settings layout if there is one.
2) On this page:
   - Identify the current auth user through the existing auth setup.
   - Look up account_prefs for that user.
     - If last_active_profile_id exists, load that profile from profiles_v2.
     - If not, create a default profile for this user:
       kind = CREATOR, visibility = PUBLIC,
       handle and display_name based on current v1 profile or auth email,
       then create an account_prefs row pointing to it.
3) Render a simple editable form:
   - Avatar URL field bound to profile_photo_url (for now just a text input, not file upload).
   - Text field for display_name.
   - Read only field for handle in this first version (we can make handle editable later).
   - Multi line text area for bio, stored in profiles_v2.quick_facts under the "bio" key.
4) Add a Save button that:
   - Updates profiles_v2.display_name.
   - Updates profiles_v2.profile_photo_url.
   - Updates profiles_v2.quick_facts with the new bio:
     read existing quick_facts JSON, change only the "bio" key, do not wipe other keys.
   - Shows a success or error message in the UI.
5) Handle loading and error states cleanly on this page.

PART 3: Navigation

1) In the existing top navigation, when a user is logged in:
   - Make clicking their avatar open the "My profile" page you just created.
   - If there is already a user menu, it is fine to add a "My profile" or "Profile" item that links to that page.
2) Do not change routing for anonymous users.

CONSTRAINTS

- Use the existing Supabase client and auth handling for this project. Do not create a new client.
- Do not touch v2 RLS policies or foreign keys.
- Do not modify or remove any v1 profile behavior. Community feed, comments, and spotlights must continue to work as they are.
- Typescript should compile without errors.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- Visiting /u/:handle for a valid v2 profile shows avatar, display name or handle, and bio (or the placeholder).
- When logged in, visiting the "My profile" page shows my active v2 profile, creating one if needed.
- I can change display_name, avatar URL, and bio on that page and see the changes reflected when I reload /u/:handle.
- Clicking my avatar in the top nav takes me to my profile settings page.
- No existing pages (community feed, spotlight pages, comments) are broken.

At the end, please summarize:
- Which routes you added
- Which files you changed
- How to test both pages as a logged in user and as a visitor.
