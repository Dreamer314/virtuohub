Three fixes:

the media is trapped in a too-narrow column/container

the headline column is too narrow, forcing ugly line breaks

arrows are anchored to the card, not the section edges

Here’s a clean prompt you can paste to Replit AI to correct all three, plus a tighter headline.

Prompt to Replit AI

“Update the Featured section proportions and controls:

Layout

Make the section a wide stage: relative max-w-[1400px] mx-auto px-6 md:px-8

Card grid: grid md:grid-cols-[1.6fr_1fr] gap-16 xl:gap-28 items-center

Media container uses a larger cinematic ratio: aspect-[21/9] md:aspect-[18/9]

Allow a slight bleed so the image feels bigger: wrap media in md:-ml-4 xl:-ml-10 and the text in md:mr-2

Image frame: w-full h-full rounded-2xl overflow-hidden shadow-[0_0_90px_rgba(120,100,255,.16)] ring-1 ring-white/8

<img>: class="w-full h-full object-cover"

Text column

Constrain width so headline doesn’t stack vertically: max-w-[36ch]

Headline classes: text-5xl md:text-6xl leading-[1.05] tracking-tight [text-wrap:balance]

Blurb: text-lg text-white/80 mt-5

Arrows

Position arrows relative to the section, not the image.

Prev: absolute top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 left-2 md:-left-16 xl:-left-28

Next: absolute top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 right-2 md:-right-16 xl:-right-28

Button style: h-12 w-12 md:h-14 md:w-14 rounded-full bg-white/6 backdrop-blur ring-1 ring-white/15 hover:bg-white/10 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-white/40 transition

Keep disabled state during slide transition

Dots

Move down a bit: container mt-10

Do not change autoplay, theme, or other sections.”

Replace the headline (reads better, fewer breaks)

Current:
“From Side Hustle to Studio: Maya Ortiz”

Use one of these:

“From side hustle to a six-figure studio”

“How Maya Ortiz turned Roblox assets into a studio”

“Turning Roblox assets into a six figure studio”

Blurb stays the same.

If it still feels small, bump the grid to md:grid-cols-[1.75fr_1fr] and keep xl:gap-28. That will force more width to the image without touching the text rhythm.
