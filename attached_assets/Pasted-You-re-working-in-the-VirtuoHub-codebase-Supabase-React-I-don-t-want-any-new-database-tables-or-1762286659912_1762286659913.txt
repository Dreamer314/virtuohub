You’re working in the VirtuoHub codebase (Supabase + React). I don’t want any new database tables or migrations for this task – this is UI polish only for the public profile page.
Goal
My public profile at /u/:handle currently works but feels like “one card in a black void.” I want it to feel like a proper Creator Profile page that fits into the rest of the VirtuoHub UI, using the data we already have:


Avatar, name, handle


Headline


About / bio


Availability: is_open_to_work, is_hiring, availability_note


Creator profile fields: primary_skill, other_skills, platforms, tools, experience_level


Portfolio & socials: portfolio/website, personal site, Twitter/X, Instagram, ArtStation, Discord, Primfeed (Primfeed field already exists in settings)


Focus on layout & presentation, not new backend logic.

1. Page framing / layout
File: client/src/pages/public-profile.tsx (and any shared layout components if needed)


Reuse the same kind of center column layout as the community/home page:


Content should sit in a max-width centered container (e.g. max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4) so it doesn’t look like a lone card floating in a huge black canvas.


Keep the dark theme, but ensure the profile sections are clearly grouped in a vertical stack of cards.




Make sure the three main sections are visually clear and in this order:


Hero block (top): avatar + name + handle + headline + availability + primary skill


“About” card


“Opportunities” card


“Creator profile” card


Each card should use the same card styling as the rest of the app (radius, border, background, padding) so it feels consistent.



2. Hero block polish (top of profile)
Use existing data; no schema changes.
In the hero area:


Keep:


Avatar


display_name


handle


headline (or fallback text if empty)


“Joined [Month Year]”


Existing “Hiring creators” badge if present




Add a small label above or beside the name that makes it explicit this is a creator profile, e.g.:


Creator Profile or VirtuoHub Creator


Make it subtle (small text, slightly muted) so it’s more of a tag than a big heading.


Add primary skill + availability in a compact, readable way:
Directly under the handle + headline area, render a row like:


A pill for primary_skill if present, e.g. 3D Modeler, World Builder, Founder / Entrepreneur, etc.


Availability badges based on existing booleans:


If is_open_to_work, show something like: ● Available for work


If is_hiring, show something like: ● Hiring creators




These should look like the existing pill/badge styles you already use for “Hiring creators”.


The idea: when you land on the page, you immediately see who they are and what they’re open to without having to scroll.


Make sure the hero looks good on mobile:


Stack elements vertically with reasonable spacing


Badges wrap nicely (no overflow)





3. “About” and “Opportunities” cards
About card


Keep the existing behavior: show about text.


If about is empty, show the existing friendly placeholder text you already have (“This is a creator profile on VirtuoHub…”).


Opportunities card


Continue to show availability_note if present.


If availability_note is empty but is_open_to_work or is_hiring is true, show a short friendly default like:


Open to new collaborations and opportunities.




If all availability fields are empty/false, you can either:


Hide the “Opportunities” card entirely, or


Show a very subtle placeholder like: No availability details listed yet.
I’m fine with whichever option is simplest and most consistent with the rest of the UI.




(Do not change the settings form text here; this is only about how the public profile renders.)

4. “Creator profile” card improvements
Still in public-profile.tsx.
This section is already showing the new fields (skills, platforms, tools, etc.). I just want it to feel more like a polished, skimmable block.


Section title




Keep the heading as Creator profile (same capitalization as current).




Group content in clear rows


Use small labels + content underneath, something like:


Primary skill
[primary_skill pill]


Other skills
Render each other_skill as a pill. If none, you can hide this row.


Platforms
Pills for platforms (Roblox, VRChat, Second Life, IMVU, Meta Horizon Worlds, GTA/FiveM, The Sims (CC), Unity, Unreal Engine, Other).


Tools
Pills for tools (Blender, Maya, ZBrush, Substance Painter, Photoshop, Marvelous Designer, Unity, Unreal, VS Code, etc.).


Experience
Show the saved experience_level value as text (e.g. 5+ years). If not set, hide the row.




Portfolio & socials


At the bottom of the Creator profile card, render a “Portfolio & socials” block with clickable links:


Show each field only if it has a value:


Portfolio / Website


Website (if you have a separate field)


Twitter / X


Instagram


ArtStation


Discord (show as text if it’s a handle, but still styled as part of the list)


Primfeed (NEW in this display – if a primfeed URL or handle field exists from settings, show it here with label “Primfeed”)




Visually, you can render each as:


A small label + anchor text on its own line (e.g. Instagram: @username), or


A row of “link pills” with an icon + label (e.g. [IG Icon] Instagram linking out)


Pick whichever best matches the rest of the app styling. The important part is that they look clearly clickable and grouped under “Portfolio & socials”.
Make sure external links open in a new tab with rel="noreferrer noopener".

5. Guard rails / constraints


Do not add or modify database tables. Use existing fields only.


Do not change multi-profile behavior – we still have one profile per user.


Do not touch the Talent directory or Job Board yet. This prompt is strictly for the public profile UI.


Keep everything responsive and consistent with the current design system (colors, typography, spacing, card radius).



6. What to show me when you’re done
When you’re finished:


Show the key snippets you changed from public-profile.tsx (and any small layout tweaks elsewhere).


Include a brief before/after summary:


How the hero changed


How the Creator profile card is now structured


How Portfolio & socials are rendered (including Primfeed)




Confirm that:


No migrations were run


Profiles with minimal data still render cleanly (no empty labels)




Please keep the explanation focused and not too long – I’m paying per prompt.
