Task: Clean up Profiles v2 UX (headline vs bio, photo saving, navigation).

I already have:

Supabase + profiles_v2 + account_prefs.

Working profile settings page at /settings/profile.

Public profile page at /u/:handle.

Avatar upload that saves immediately and a single about/bio field.

Please do the following, without touching v1 profiles, RLS, or auth:

Add a “headline” field to profiles_v2

Add a new headline text column to public.profiles_v2 (nullable, default NULL).

Do not remove about or quick_facts. about stays as the main bio.

Update profile settings UI

File: client/src/pages/profile-settings.tsx

In the form, add a new text input called “Headline” between Display Name and Handle.

Wire it to the new headline column:

Load headline when fetching the active profile.

Allow editing headline and include it in the update mutation.

Keep about as the “Bio” textarea.

Change public profile layout

File: client/src/pages/public-profile.tsx

Use these rules:

Under the handle (@handle), show profile.headline if present.

If headline is empty, you can show nothing or a simple default like “Creator on VirtuoHub”.

In the About section, show only profile.about (the bio).

If about is empty, show the placeholder “This creator has not added a bio yet.” inside the About card.

Remove the duplicate where the bio text appears both under the handle and again in About.

Change avatar upload behavior

Currently the avatar is uploaded and saved immediately when a file is selected.

I want this behavior instead:

When a file is selected:

Show a preview of the new photo and a status like “Photo selected (not saved yet)”.

Store the file in component state only; do not upload to Supabase yet.

When the user clicks Save Changes:

If a new file has been selected, upload it to the existing avatars bucket and update profiles_v2.profile_photo_url.

Then save the other profile fields (display_name, headline, about) in the same submit flow.

After success, clear the “pending file” state and show the “Profile updated” toast.

Keep the cache invalidation for the avatar/header working after save.

Navigation improvements

On the profile settings page:

Add a small text link above “My Profile” or near the top:
← Back to VirtuoHub that routes to / (or the main home route used in this project).

Make the “View your public profile at /u/:handle” text at the bottom into a clear link/button that navigates to the correct /u/:handle route.

In the header component (client/src/components/layout/header.tsx):

Clicking the avatar in the top-right should navigate to the user’s public profile /u/:handle.

Clicking the user’s name in the header should go to /settings/profile (keep this behavior).

General rules

Do not change RLS policies, auth, or any v1 tables.

Keep all existing types strict and update them where needed (e.g. add headline to the profile types).

After making changes, run through this flow:

Visit /settings/profile, change display name, headline, upload a photo, and edit bio.

Click Save Changes and verify everything persists.

Visit /u/:handle and confirm:

Avatar shows.

Headline shows under handle.

Bio appears only in About.

Joined date still shows.

Click the avatar in the header and confirm it goes to the public profile.

Confirm that navigating back from settings via the new “Back to VirtuoHub” link works.

Please summarize exactly what you changed and which files were touched when you’re done.
