You are a senior Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind engineer. Add a Charts Hero above the charts tabs on /community/lists. Use the site’s existing tokens and the three modes (light, dark, charcoal). Do not invent new colors or theme variables.

Context

The lists page currently has no hero; the content starts with tabs and copy.

We want a hero similar to the mock the PM provided: large headline, subtle grid background, big translucent “#1” watermark, right-side media slot (video/slideshow/image), and two CTAs.

A “Presented by MetaVerse Studios” label appears in places — remove any hard-coded sponsor defaults. Sponsor chip should render only if explicitly passed.

Tasks

Create component

File: components/charts/ChartsHero.tsx

Props:

export interface ChartsHeroProps {
  sponsorName?: string;
  sponsorHref?: string;
  heroMedia?:
    | { type: "image"; imageUrl: string; caption?: string }
    | { type: "slideshow"; slides: Array<{ imageUrl: string; title?: string }> }
    | { type: "video"; src: string; poster?: string; caption?: string };
}


Mount on page

Import and render <ChartsHero /> at the very top of the center column on /community/lists, above the chart tabs.

Add id="charts-start" to the tabs wrapper so the hero’s “Explore all charts” CTA can anchor-scroll.

Hero layout & content (match the mock)

Eyebrow: VHUB Charts

H1 (large, bold): The scoreboards of the immersive creator economy.

Subline: Updated weekly with data on creators, platforms, and momentum.

Two CTAs:

Primary link button → #charts-start label: Explore all charts

Secondary button → opens existing Methodology modal label: Methodology

Optional sponsor chip (top right): only render if sponsorName is provided. Remove all hard-coded defaults across repo (search and delete “MetaVerse Studios” fallbacks).

Background styling

Rounded container with an existing surface bg + ring/border utilities from the design system.

Add a faint geometric grid overlay and a large translucent “#1” watermark behind the headline (absolutely positioned, pointer-events-none, low opacity). Must adapt to light/dark/charcoal via current tokens.

Media slot (right side)

A rounded rectangle “frame” with a soft glow ring.

If heroMedia.type === "image": render image with object-cover.

If slideshow: cross-fade between slides every 4s. Respect prefers-reduced-motion (pause animation).

If video: render muted, looped, with poster and play/pause control; keyboard accessible.

Utilities (use existing tokens; add only small class helpers)

Add these utilities to your global styles (Tailwind @apply, no new colors):

.vh-eyebrow { @apply uppercase tracking-wide text-xs font-semibold text-accent; }
.vh-hero    { @apply text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-extrabold leading-tight; }
.vh-meta    { @apply text-sm opacity-80; }
.btn-primary   { @apply inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-full px-4 py-2 font-medium bg-accent text-accent-foreground hover:opacity-90 transition; }
.btn-secondary { @apply inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-full px-4 py-2 font-medium ring-1 ring-border hover:bg-surface/70 transition; }


Component structure (use these class ideas; adapt to your tokens)

Wrapper: relative overflow-hidden rounded-2xl p-6 md:p-10 bg-surface/80 ring-1 ring-border/50

Grid overlay: absolute inset with very low opacity using border color

Watermark #1: absolutely positioned, very large font size, low opacity

Right media frame: fixed 16:9 box that collapses neatly on mobile (stack below text)

Accessibility

Ensure visible focus for CTAs and media controls.

Provide aria-label for the media frame buttons.

Hide decorative watermark/grid from AT (aria-hidden).

Remove sponsor default

Search the codebase for the string “MetaVerse Studios” and remove any default use in charts or hero. Sponsor chip renders only when sponsorName is passed.

Tests

Snapshot test: hero renders eyebrow, H1, subline, CTAs.

Unit test: sponsor chip does not render without sponsorName.

Unit test: slideshow respects prefers-reduced-motion.

Acceptance criteria

/community/lists shows a branded hero above tabs with eyebrow, large H1, subline, two CTAs, subtle grid, and a translucent #1 watermark.

Optional sponsor chip is hidden by default and only appears when props are provided.

Media slot supports image/slideshow/video and is responsive.

“Explore all charts” anchors to the tabs.

Styling fits existing light/dark/charcoal modes; no new colors added.

No “MetaVerse Studios” appears anywhere unless passed as sponsorNam
