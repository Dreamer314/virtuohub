Charts cleanup, voice logic, titles, and detail-page polish”

You are a senior Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind engineer. Use the site’s existing design tokens and the three modes (light, dark, charcoal). Do not invent new theme variables. Maintain accessibility.

Context: what’s wrong right now

VHUB 100 shows mixed “VHub Picks / User Choice” badges per row, which makes the authoritative chart feel arbitrary.

“Pro” label appears on the VHUB 100 tab button without a gating context.

The Platforms Index chart shows voice badges and filters that only make sense for creator charts.

“Curated Collections from the Community” mislabels the lists section; these are editorial + data-driven industry lists, not community-submitted.

Suggest Update only fires a toast; there’s no modal to actually submit a suggestion.

Some lists (e.g., “Fastest Growing Studios in 2024”) reference Studios before that feature is live.

The List Detail page is visually flat; no hierarchy for Top 3, no sponsor slot, and weak typography.

Goal

Keep one charts section at the top of /community/lists, then the lists grid below. Make charts feel like scoreboards, clarify “voice” logic, correct titles, and add a real Suggest Update flow. Improve the list detail page for hierarchy and excitement.

Do this, in order
0) Safety

Create a branch: fix/charts-cleanup-voice-detail.

1) Voice logic (critical)

Do not show VHub Picks / User Choice badges per-row on VHUB 100 and Momentum 50.

Instead implement a Chart Voice switcher for creator charts:

Toggle component with two modes: Editorial (VHub Picks) | Community Choice.

When “Editorial” is active, show only entries from the editorial dataset; when “Community Choice” is active, show only entries ranked by community poll data.

Persist the voice in the URL search params: ?voice=editorial or ?voice=community.

Remove voice badges from each row for creator charts; keep a small voice chip near the chart header showing the current mode.

Platforms Index: never shows voice switcher or badges.

2) Tabs and definitions

Tabs (pill group): VHUB 100, Platforms Index, Momentum 50.

Remove Studios Watchlist tab until Studios is live.

Directly under the active tab, render:

VHUB 100: “The top 100 creators across immersive platforms ranked by multi-signal reach and impact over the last 30 days.”

Platforms Index: “Where creators are thriving most, based on earnings potential, engagement, and activity.”

Momentum 50: “The fastest rising creators, streamers, and studios over the past 30 days.”

3) Filters (contextual)

VHUB 100 and Momentum 50: show Voice switcher (from step 1), Platform multi-select, Sort (Most Recent, Most Viewed).

Platforms Index: show Platform multi-select and Sort only.

All filter state syncs to URL params; do not render irrelevant chips.

4) Remove confusing labels

Remove the “PRO” label from the VHUB 100 tab button.

Keep Pro gating behavior for VHUB 100: non-Pro users see Top 10, then a frosted overlay with an “Unlock full VHUB 100” CTA card. Make the gating copy clear and premium.

5) Table schemas (per chart)

VHUB 100 (creators only): columns = Rank, Avatar, Creator, Platforms (pills), Impact Score (label + value), Movement (▲ +N / ▼ −N / NEW), optional Streak (“#1 for N weeks”).

Platforms Index (platforms only): columns = Rank, Platform logo, Platform, Category, Creator Earnings Index (label + value), Movement, Streak. Add an info tooltip on the metric header: “Composite score using earnings potential, creator activity, and engagement trend over the last 30 days.”

Momentum 50 (creators only): columns = Rank, Avatar, Creator, Platforms, 30-day Growth, Movement, NEW badge for first-timers.

Do not mix entities within a chart. Remove column title “Creator/Platform”.

6) Lists grid naming & hygiene

Rename section header from “Curated Collections from the Community” to “Featured Industry Lists” (H1) and a subline “Editor-led and data-driven rankings, roundups, and best-of lists.”

Hide or rename any Studios list cards until Studios is live.

Keep chips: Charting / Upcoming / Best Of / Entertainment. Keep platform pills as metadata only.

7) Suggest Update (real flow)

Replace the toast with a modal form:

Fields: Name (optional), Email (optional), “What should we update?” (textarea, required), optional URL field.

On submit: write to mock queue or JSON store and show success state in the modal.

Keep a small note: “Thank you—submissions are reviewed and may take up to X days to reflect.”

8) List Detail page (visual hierarchy)

Add hero banner with cover image, chips (list type + voice), large title, dek, platform pills, and a sponsor slot under the header (“Presented by <sponsor>”).

Top 3 entries get a highlight row with gold/silver/bronze accents and larger avatars.

Remaining entries use compact ranked rows.

Right under the header add a small methodology inline link that jumps to “How we built this list.”

Keep “How we built this list” section but format it as a well-styled card.

9) Utilities (reuse only—no new tokens)

Use Tailwind @apply to keep typography consistent:

.vh-eyebrow = uppercase, tracking-wide, text-accent, text-xs, font-bold

.vh-hero = display-xl, font-extrabold, tight leading

.vh-meta = text-sm, opacity-80

.vh-rank = text-3xl, font-bold, tabular-nums

.vh-chip = shared chip for NEW, up, down, streak

Apply to ChartHeader, ChartTabs, ChartTable, and List Detail header.

10) Data layer and tests

Charts read from lib/data/charts.ts with helpers: getChartById(id), getChartsList().

Creator charts accept a voice param (editorial | community) to switch datasets.

Unit tests:

Voice switcher toggles datasets and URL param.

Platforms Index never renders voice UI.

VHUB 100 gating triggers after Top 10 for non-Pro.

Column configs per chart render correct headers.

Acceptance criteria

On /community/lists, there is one charts section at top; tabs = VHUB 100, Platforms Index, Momentum 50.

Voice is a top-level toggle for creator charts only; no per-row voice badges.

Pro label is removed from the tab; gating for VHUB 100 is clear after Top 10.

Lists grid title reads “Featured Industry Lists” with the new subline; no Studios items appear.

Suggest Update opens a modal form and persists to the mock store.

List Detail page has a hero banner, Top-3 highlight, compact remainder, and a sponsor slot.

Layout, spacing, and modes (light/dark/charcoal) are consistent with the rest of Community.

If file paths differ, adapt while preserving these behaviors and strings. Document any deviations in the README.
