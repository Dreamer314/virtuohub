Title: PLAN FIRST, WAIT FOR YES — Fix image display with strict scope

SCOPE
Touch only:
1) client/src/components/composer/CreatePostModal.tsx
2) client/src/components/cards/PostCard.tsx
3) server/supabaseStorage.ts

Do not touch any other files. If you previously added server/storageSetup.ts or edited server/index.ts for bucket init, propose a revert but do not change anything until I say YES.

GOAL
Make post images show in the Community feed. DB has public.posts.image_urls text[] set. Storage bucket and policies are done. Client already sends image_urls on create.

FLOW (two step)
Step 1 — PLAN ONLY. No edits yet.
- Inspect current code.
- Output a precise plan with:
  a) The exact lines you will change in each allowed file.
  b) Unified diff previews for each file.
  c) A 3-item risk checklist.
  d) A 4-step manual test checklist.
- Then STOP and print: “WAITING FOR YES”

Step 2 — Only if I reply YES.
- Apply exactly the proposed changes. No extra edits. No formatting or lint changes outside touched lines.
- Do not add files. Do not change deps. Do not change env. Do not modify routing, auth, styles, or server startup.
- If reverting earlier scope creep is needed, revert only the specific lines you proposed.
- After changes, output the final diffs and a short verification log of what you tested.

TECH NOTES TO FOLLOW IN PLAN
Server mapping:
- Ensure post SELECT includes image_urls.
- Map row.image_urls to images in the object returned by getPosts and getPost.
- In createPost insert, include image_urls: Array.isArray((post as any).image_urls) ? (post as any).image_urls : [].

Card render:
- In PostCard, derive const images from post.images, with a fallback to post.image_urls.
- Render first image if present.

Composer payload:
- Ensure payload sends image_urls: string[] and links is always an array.

If any change outside the 3 files is truly required, STOP and explain why, with a minimal alternative that stays within scope.

Now produce Step 1 only.
