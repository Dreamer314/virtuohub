YES — proceed with Phase 2 using your plan, plus these additions/constraints:

Additions

Header menu entry

When isTemporary === true, add a “Complete your profile” item in the account menu that opens the same WelcomeModal.

This must be implemented now in Phase 2.

Event gating

Trigger the WelcomeModal only on the first SIGNED_IN for a user without localStorage['welcomed_<userId>'].

Ignore non-interactive auth events like TOKEN_REFRESH or rehydration so the modal doesn’t pop unexpectedly.

Identity refresh

After successful submit, invalidate/refetch the ['/api/profile'] query so the header flips from user_<shortId> to @handle immediately.

Never show email/real name in chrome.

No routing/redirects

Keep the modal purely client state. No setLocation/navigation.

Do not change /onboarding routing; leave that page as a manual/fallback path for now.

Avatar upload robustness

Use the existing avatars bucket. If upload fails, show a small non-blocking error and allow submit with just the handle.

Copy (use exactly)

Welcome title: “Welcome to VirtuoHub”

Welcome subtitle: “Pick a username and photo so people know it’s you.”

Primary button: “Complete profile”

Close confirm title: “Leave setup for now?”

Close confirm body: “You can keep browsing and posting with a temporary identity. You can finish your profile anytime.”

Close confirm buttons: “Finish now” (stay) / “Do it later” (close)

Header menu item: “Complete your profile”

Guard rails

Minimal diffs only.

No schema or storage policy changes.

No anonymous redirects.

Don’t touch admin logic, analytics, or unrelated routes/styles.

Do not remove OnboardingGuard.tsx yet; don’t import it anywhere new.

Report back (PASS/FAIL)

Fresh signup → Welcome appears once (no URL change).

X → confirm dialog → “Do it later” closes; user continues with temp identity.

“Complete profile” with unique handle → modal closes; header shows @handle immediately.

When isTemporary === true, header menu shows “Complete your profile” and opens the modal.

Anonymous browsing never triggers the modal.

No regressions in admin/nav. No new deps.

Wait for my confirmation after your report before moving on.
