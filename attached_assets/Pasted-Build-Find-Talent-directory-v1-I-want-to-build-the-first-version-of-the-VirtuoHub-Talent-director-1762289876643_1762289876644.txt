Build “Find Talent” directory v1

I want to build the first version of the VirtuoHub Talent directory, using the existing Profiles v2 system and the new Creator Profile fields we just added.

Goal: A new Find Talent page that lists creator profiles in a clean card layout with basic filters. This will live at /talent and use our existing header/footer layout and Profiles v2 data (no multi-profile, one profile per user).

1. New route and layout

Create a new page at client/src/pages/talent.tsx (or whatever route convention we use) that:

Uses the same <Header /> and <Footer /> as /community and /u/:handle.

Wraps content in max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 py-10 with min-h-screen flex flex-col.

Page title block at the top, something like:

Title: VirtuoHub Talent

Subtitle: “Discover creators to collaborate with across virtual worlds.”

Directly under the title, add two tabs:

Find Talent (selected, active)

Find Work (disabled / “Coming soon” pill, just a button with no navigation yet)

Use our existing tab style if we have one; otherwise simple buttons with an underline for the active tab is fine.

2. Data source

Use Profiles v2 as the data source, only profiles where:

visibility = 'PUBLIC'

And we have at least a display_name and handle.

Re-use the fields we already use on the public profile:

display_name, handle, profile_photo_url, headline

about (for a short summary)

is_open_to_work, is_hiring, availability_note

Creator profile fields (wherever they’re stored now – likely in quick_facts JSON):

primarySkill

otherSkills (array)

platforms (array)

tools (array)

experienceLevel

Please reuse the same options & labels we use in profile settings so filters match the form.

If we don’t already have an API endpoint for listing profiles with filters, create one under our existing API pattern (e.g. /api/profile-v2/search or similar) that:

Returns public profiles with the above fields.

Accepts optional query params for: primarySkill, platform, tool, and a general q text search.

Filters should be simple and safe (e.g. ILIKE on text fields / matching inside JSON arrays).

3. Filters section (top of page content)

Add a filter row under the tabs with:

Primary skill – dropdown (single select) populated from the same list as the Creator Profile form. Include an “Any skill” / empty option.

Platform – dropdown (single select) from the same platform options we use in settings (including GTA/FiveM and The Sims CC and “Other”).

Tools – dropdown (single select) from the existing tools options plus “Other”.

A Search input (q) for free-text search across name, handle and about.

A Clear filters text button that resets everything.

Filters should be controlled React state and trigger a refetch using our query library (React Query / TanStack query) with a stable key (e.g. ['talent-directory', filters]).

4. Talent cards layout

Below the filters, render a responsive grid/list of cards:

On desktop: 2 columns (or 3 if it looks good), on mobile: 1 column.

Each card should include:

Avatar (small circle) + display_name + @handle.

Primary skill pill (if set), e.g. 3D Modeler or Store Owner.

Availability pills:

If is_open_to_work → show green-dot pill “Available for work”.

If is_hiring → show blue-dot pill “Hiring creators”.

Short summary text:

Use about truncated to ~120–160 chars with an ellipsis.

Fallback: “Creator on VirtuoHub.” if about is empty.

Tag row(s):

Platforms: show up to 3 platform pills, then +N more if there are additional entries.

Tools: same pattern (up to 3 tools, then +N more).

Experience level line if present (e.g. “Experience: 5+ years”).

Primary action button: View profile → links to /u/:handle in the same tab.

Use our existing card styles (rounded, subtle border, dark background, hover state) to match the rest of the app.

5. Loading, empty & error states

Loading: skeleton cards (or at least a “Loading creators…” message) while the query runs.

Empty results: show a friendly message like:

“No creators match these filters yet. Try removing a filter or broadening your search.”

Error: show a simple error state with a retry button using the query’s refetch.

6. QA checklist

Please test and confirm:

Filters work together (e.g. pick Primary Skill + Platform + type a search query).

Clearing filters reloads the full list.

Clicking “View profile” opens the correct /u/:handle page.

Profiles with minimal data still render gracefully (e.g. no tools/platforms → those rows are hidden).

The page looks good on desktop and mobile.

Finally, add a short section to replit.md documenting:

The new /talent page

The API endpoint used for listing/filtering profiles

Which profile fields power the directory (primarySkill, platforms, tools, availability, etc.)
