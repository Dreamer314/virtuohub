You are a senior Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind engineer. Build a production-quality Lists system for the VirtuoHub Community. Use the project’s existing design tokens, components, and three display modes (light, dark, charcoal). Do not invent new visual themes. Match the existing spacing, elevations, borders, shadows, and typography by consuming the current classes and variables. Where styles are unclear, use the site’s established primitives.

Tech + Project Assumptions

Stack: Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind.

Use existing Community layout shell. If not present, create a minimal shell that fits the current site nav and slots. When the real shell exists, your pages must drop in with no visual drift.

State: URL search params for filters and sorting. Keep state minimal.

Data: create a mock data layer now with clear interfaces and async functions that can be swapped to Supabase later. Include seed JSON in /data.

Icons: lucide-react. Animations: only where the project already uses them.

Accessibility: semantic headings, aria labels, keyboard focus, readable contrasts across all three modes.

Quality: type-safe, lint-clean, documented.

What to Build

Route + Page Shell

Add route: /community/lists.

Use the existing Community layout. If missing, provide a minimal shell with three columns: left nav (existing community links and platform filters), center content for Lists, right rail for “Upcoming Events” and sponsor slot. Respect existing breakpoints and gutters.

Billboard Hero (Signature)

At the top of /community/lists, render a Billboard/Charting hero with tabs:

Top Creators

Most Downloaded Assets

Fastest Growing Studios

Top Platforms to Earn In

Each tab shows a ranked table (1–10) with avatar/logo, title, platform pills, a metric, delta vs last update, and badges:

VHub Picks and User Choice badges can both appear.

Include “Last updated” text, a “Methodology” tooltip modal, and a “Suggest an update” feedback form (mock handler).

Filter Bar

Sticky sub-header under the hero with:

Type segmented control: Charting | Upcoming | Best Of | Entertainment

Voice checkboxes: VHub Picks, User Choice

Platform multi-select (Roblox, VRChat, Second Life, IMVU, Horizon Worlds, Sims, GTA RP, Unity, Unreal, InZoi, Cross-Platform)

Sort: Most Recent, Most Viewed, Highest Rated

Sync all controls with URL search params so views are shareable.

List Grid

Responsive grid using existing card primitives. Do not introduce new card styles.

Card contents:

Tag chip: Charting | Upcoming | Best Of | Entertainment

Optional badges: VHub Picks, User Choice

Title, cover image, short dek, platform pills, “Updated on” date

Footer: views count, save, share

Card click → detail page.

List Detail Route

Route: /community/lists/[slug]

Header: title, tags, badges, platforms, updated date, optional sponsor slot.

Body supports two modes:

Numbered ranking (1..N) with optional metric column and per-item CTA.

Curated list (unordered) for Best Of or Upcoming.

Right rail: “Related Lists,” “Courses for this topic,” “Marketplace items” using mock data hooks.

Footer: disclosure “How we built this list” and a Poll widget to capture User Choice votes. Poll writes to mock layer for now.

Resources Handling

Do not make “Resources” a Lists type. Create a reusable ResourceCard and a /resources route stub. Resource-style lists still live under Best Of and can cross-link to /resources.

Data Models + Mock Layer

Create interfaces in types/:

export type Platform =
  | "Roblox" | "VRChat" | "Second Life" | "IMVU" | "Horizon Worlds"
  | "Sims" | "GTA RP" | "Unity" | "Unreal" | "InZoi" | "Cross-Platform";

export type ListType = "Charting" | "Upcoming" | "Best Of" | "Entertainment";
export type VoiceTag = "VHub Picks" | "User Choice";

export interface ListItemEntry {
  id: string;
  rank?: number;
  title: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
  platforms: Platform[];
  metricLabel?: string;
  metricValue?: number;
  ctaLabel?: string;
  ctaHref?: string;
  summary?: string;
}

export interface ListMeta {
  id: string;
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  type: ListType;
  voices: VoiceTag[];
  platforms: Platform[];
  coverImageUrl?: string;
  dek?: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  views: number;
  isSponsored?: boolean;
  sponsorName?: string;
  sponsorHref?: string;
}

export interface FullList extends ListMeta {
  methodology?: string;
  items: ListItemEntry[];
}


Seed file: data/lists.seed.json with at least 2 Charting, 2 Upcoming, 2 Best Of, 1 Entertainment examples.

Data API in lib/data/lists.ts:

getLists(params) with filters for type, voices, platforms, sort, pagination

getListBySlug(slug)

incrementViews(slug)

submitUserVote(listId, itemId) to a simple JSON vote store

Keep signatures stable so they can be mapped directly to Supabase later.

Components

components/lists/BillboardHero.tsx

components/lists/ListFilters.tsx (controls URL params)

components/lists/ListCard.tsx

components/lists/ListGrid.tsx

components/lists/MethodologyModal.tsx

components/common/PlatformPill.tsx

components/common/Badge.tsx for VHub Picks and User Choice

components/ads/SponsorBanner.tsx

components/poll/PollWidget.tsx

components/rails/RelatedLists.tsx

components/rails/ContextCTAs.tsx for Courses, Marketplace, Workshops

Reusability Across Community

Abstract filter logic, card primitives, rail components, and poll widget so they can be reused by Spotlights, Interviews, Tips & Guides, Industry News, Trending, Events, Pulse Reports without code duplication.

Place shared utilities under components/common/ and lib/ui/.

Routing, Metadata, Access

Add SEO metadata to Lists index and list detail.

Generate OG images for list detail using the site’s existing OG pattern.

Add a simple useProAccess() mock. If user is not Pro, reveal first 3 items then show an upgrade callout. Gate is easy to disable via a flag.

Ads + Sponsorship

Right rail SponsorBanner slot on Lists index and detail. Accept props for image, alt, href, and show a “Sponsored” label.

Testing + README

Vitest unit tests for getLists filtering and sorting.

Ensure pnpm lint and typecheck pass.

Notes on reusing components for other Community sections

Goal: Visiting /community/lists shows a polished Lists index with Billboard hero, working filters, a grid of list cards, and navigable detail pages. All visuals automatically respect the existing light, dark, and charcoal modes. All data flows through the mock layer and is ready to swap to Supabase.

If anything is unclear, make a sensible choice, match the established design system, and document the decision in the README.
