Fix admin role using profiles_v2.kind

My Supabase profiles_v2 table has an enum column kind (type profile_kind_v2) with values CREATOR, STUDIO, and ADMIN.
The row with handle Virtuohub_Founder has kind = 'ADMIN'.

But in the app:

The badge next to my name still shows user instead of admin.

Going to /admin shows “Admin only – You must be an administrator to view this page.”

There is no “Admin” link in the top navigation bar.

Please do the following steps and keep them strictly scoped to admin detection (don’t touch creator options, talent, or job config):

Find how admin is currently checked

Search for the text Admin only and You must be an administrator to view this page. and identify the condition used (e.g. user.role === 'admin' or reading a role column from user_profiles).

Switch admin detection to profiles_v2.kind

Wherever the app decides whether a user is an admin (for /admin, for showing the Admin nav item, and for rendering the admin badge), change the logic so it uses the current user’s profiles_v2.kind.

isAdmin should be true when profiles_v2.kind === 'ADMIN'.

It’s OK to keep a fallback like || userProfiles.role === 'admin', but profiles_v2.kind === 'ADMIN' must work by itself.

Update the TypeScript schema

In shared/schema.ts (or wherever the Drizzle schema lives), make sure the enum for profile_kind_v2 includes "ADMIN" and that profiles_v2.kind uses that enum.

Wire this into nav + badges

Top nav: show the Admin link only when isAdmin is true (from profiles_v2.kind).

Post / thread cards: where the small user / admin badge is rendered next to the handle, use the same isAdmin check so Virtuohub_Founder shows admin.

Test with my real account

Run the app, log in as @Virtuohub_Founder.

Confirm:

Admin link appears in the top nav.

/admin no longer shows the “Admin only” message.

Posts by Virtuohub_Founder show the admin badge instead of user.

Finally, summarize exactly which files you changed and what condition is now used to determine isAdmin.
